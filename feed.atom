        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DNA variants that arise after conception can show mosaicism, varying in presence and extent among tissues. Mosaic variants have been reported in Mendelian diseases, but further investigation is necessary to broadly understand their incidence, transmission, and clinical impact. A mosaic pathogenic variant in a disease-related gene may cause an atypical phenotype in terms of severity, clinical features, or timing of disease onset. Using high-depth sequencing, we studied results from one million...]]></summary>

CH has been linked to increased risk of blood cancers, but CH has also been linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes.]]></summary>

Recent advances in intravital imaging has suggested that the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and acute myeloid leukemia cells is restricted to bone marrow microdomains during a distinct stage of bone remodeling. These findings indicate that dynamic bone...]]></summary>

Recent large-scale studies have demonstrated that distinct molecular abnormalities detected at earlier stages of MDS alter disease biology and predict progression to AML. Consistently, various studies analyzing these diseases at the single-cell level have identified specific patterns of progression...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a result of the selective expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying somatic mutations originating from a primary HSC. The advent of modern genomic technologies has helped recognizing that CH is common in elderly healthy subjects as a result of the aging bone marrow (BM). CH in healthy subjects without abnormalities in blood counts is known as CH of indeterminate potential. CH is also seen in BM failure (BMF) disorders. Whether CH alarms...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CONCLUSIONS: IDH1/2 mutations are most frequently accompanied by DNMT3A, SRSF2 and NPM1 mutations. NPM1-IDH1/2 mutated AML has a mature phenotype possibly amenable to differentiation therapies. IDH1/2 and SRSF2 mutations probably arise at the same developmental stage of the disease, as their allele burdens covariate. IDH1/2 mutation represents CHIP in a substantial proportion of cases and is therefore no reliable residual disease marker. The preferential presence of IDH1/2 mutations among...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Somatic mutations, described as noninherited changes in DNA that arise and are passed on to descendant cells, are well known to cause cancers; however, it is increasingly appreciated that the propagation of somatic mutations within a tissue may have a role in causing nonneoplastic disorders and abnormalities in elderly individuals. The nonmalignant clonal expansion of somatic mutations in the hematopoietic system is termed clonal hematopoiesis. This review will briefly discuss...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a prevalent condition that results from the acquisition of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells. When these mutations occur in "driver" genes, they can potentially confer fitness advantages to the cell, leading to a clonal expansion. While most clonal expansions of mutant cells are generally considered to be asymptomatic since they do not impact overall blood cell numbers, CH carriers display long-term risks of all-cause mortality and...]]></summary>

However, although genomic ITH has been characterized in genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations are hallmarks of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the extent to which these are heterogeneous in ESCC has not been explored in a unified framework. Further, the extent to which tumor-infiltrated T lymphocytes are directed against cancer cells, but how the immune infiltration acts as a...]]></summary>

High-risk neuroblastoma patients have a poor overall survival and account for ~15% of childhood cancer deaths. There is thus a need for clinically relevant and authentic models of neuroblastoma that closely resemble the human disease to further interrogate underlying mechanisms and to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Here we review recent developments in patient-derived neuroblastoma xenograft models and in...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) are the clonal expansion of large somatically acquired structural chromosomal changes present on the autosomes and sex chromosomes. Most studies of mCAs use existing genotype array intensity data from large populations to investigate potential risk factors and disease outcomes associated with mCAs. In this review, we perform a comprehensive examination of existing evidence for mCA disease and mortality associations and provide a framework for interpreting...]]></summary>
