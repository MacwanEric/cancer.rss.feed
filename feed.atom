        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite a strong rationale for why cancer cells are susceptible to redox-targeting drugs, such drugs often face tumor resistance or dose-limiting toxicity in preclinical and clinical studies. An important reason is the lack of specific biomarkers to better select susceptible cancer entities and stratify patients. Using a large panel of lung cancer cell lines, we identified a set of "antioxidant-capacity" biomarkers (ACB), which were tightly repressed, partly by STAT3 and STAT5A/B in sensitive...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CONCLUSIONS: The current literature supports the hypothesis that host genetic factors affect vulnerability to severe COVID-19. Further research is required to confirm the full scope of relevant variants and the causal mechanisms underlying these associations. Clinical approaches, which consider the genetic basis of interindividual variability in COVID-19 and potentially other causes of critical illness, could optimize hospital resource allocation, predict responsiveness to treatment, identify...]]></summary>

Novel methods of quantifying spatial tumour data at the cellular scale are required to link evolutionary dynamics to the resulting spatial architecture of the tumour. Here, we propose a framework using first passage times of random walks to quantify the complex spatial patterns of tumour cell population...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis (CH)-associated mutations increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However, it is unclear whether the mutations detected in circulating blood cells can also be detected in tissues associated with atherosclerosis, where they could affect physiology locally. To address this, the presence of CH mutations in peripheral blood, atherosclerotic lesions and associated tissues was assessed in a pilot study of 31 consecutive patients with peripheral vascular...]]></summary>

However, CAR T is associated with frequently severe toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and prolonged cytopenias-a reduction in the number of mature blood cells...]]></summary>

Furthermore, available studies reporting findings on drug-induced HTN in MPNs report varying and contradictory findings. In consideration of the above, this study set out to systematically review the available literature and shed light on the occurrence of HTN in...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is one of the most common genomic abnormalities in cancers. WGD can provide a source of redundant genes to buffer the deleterious effect of somatic alterations and facilitate clonal evolution in cancer cells. The extra DNA and centrosome burden after WGD is associated with an elevation of genome instability. Causes of genome instability are multifaceted and occur throughout the cell cycle. Among these are DNA damage caused by the abortive mitosis that initially...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The TP53 gene is a major player in cancer formation, and it is considered the most important tumor suppressor gene. The p53 protein acts as a transcription factor, and it is involved in DNA repair, senescence, cell-cycle control, autophagy, and apoptosis. Beyond cancer, there is evidence that TP53 is associated with fertility, aging, and longevity. Additionally, more evidence exists that genetic variants in TP53 are associated with environmental adaptation. Special TP53 amino-acid residues or...]]></summary>

However, these technologies cannot be readily utilized to study hematopoiesis in humans. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop strategies to assess cellular dynamics within human hematopoietic tissues in vivo. Recently, researchers have utilized naturally acquired somatic mutations, coupled...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genome variation is the direct cause of cancer and driver of its clonal evolution. While the impact of many point mutations can be evaluated through their modification of individual genomic elements, even a single copy number aberration (CNA) may encompass hundreds of genes and therefore pose challenges to untangle potentially complex functional effects. However, consistent, recurring and disease-specific patterns in the genome-wide CNA landscape imply that particular CNA may promote...]]></summary>
