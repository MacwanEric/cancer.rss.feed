        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable hematologic malignancy characterized by a multistep evolutionary pathway, with an initial phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), potentially evolving into the symptomatic disease, often preceded by an intermediate phase called "smoldering" MM (sMM). From a biological point of view, genomic alterations (translocations/deletions/mutations) are already present at the MGUS phase, thus rendering their role in disease evolution...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome associated with germline TP53 pathogenic variants. Here, we perform whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis of tumors from 22 patients with TP53 germline pathogenic variants. We observe somatic mutations affecting Wnt, PI3K/AKT signaling, epigenetic modifiers and homologous recombination genes as well as mutational signatures associated with prior chemotherapy. We identify near-ubiquitous early loss of heterozygosity of TP53,...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During embryogenesis, haematopoietic and endothelial lineages emerge closely in time and space. It is thought that the first blood and endothelium derive from a common clonal ancestor, the haemangioblast. However, investigation of candidate haemangioblasts in vitro revealed the capacity for mesenchymal differentiation, a feature more compatible with an earlier mesodermal precursor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mutations in the gene Additional Sex-Combs Like 1 (ASXL1) are recurrent in myeloid malignancies as well as the pre-malignant condition clonal hematopoiesis, where they are universally associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of ASXL1 in myeloid lineage maturation is incompletely described. To define the role of ASXL1 in myelopoiesis, we employed single cell RNA sequencing and a murine model of hematopoietic-specific Asxl1 deletion. In granulocyte progenitors, Asxl1 deletion leads to...]]></summary>
