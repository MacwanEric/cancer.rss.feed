        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past two decades since the first sequencing of the human genome, clinical genomics has undergone a renaissance with the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Whole genome sequencing is now increasingly available in the clinical setting at a fraction of the cost of the human genome reference sequence, and with turnaround times as short as 7-10days. Clinical genetics-based management has become more tractable with improved payer reimbursement and increased availability of...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest ITH as a potential unfavorable prognostic factor in PTC and highlight the dynamic changes in different clinical stages of PTC, providing some clues for the precision medicine and suggesting different diagnostic decisions depending on the clinical stages of patients. Finally, complete clear guidelines to define risk stratification of PTC patients are lacking; thus, this work could contribute to defining patients who need more aggressive treatments and, in turn,...]]></summary>

Multiple studies have shown associations between clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells with hematopoietic malignancies and cardiometabolic disease. This expansion of clones in the absence of overt hematopoietic disorders is termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH) of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Using deep, error-corrected, targeted DNA sequencing we assayed for somatic mutations in CH-driver...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) affects 20,000 patients in the US annually with a five-year survival rate of approximately 25%. One reason for the low survival rate is the high prevalence of clonal evolution that gives rise to heterogeneous sub-populations of leukemic cells with diverse mutation spectra, which eventually leads to disease relapse. This genetic heterogeneity drives the activation of complex signaling pathways that is reflected at the protein level. This diversity makes it difficult...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) mediate regeneration of the hematopoietic system following injury, such as following infection or inflammation. These challenges impair HSC function, but whether this functional impairment extends beyond the duration of inflammatory exposure is unknown. Unexpectedly, we observed an irreversible depletion of functional HSCs following challenge with inflammation or bacterial infection, with no evidence of any recovery up to 1 year afterward. HSCs from challenged...]]></summary>

Recent studies have better defined the genetics underlying this diverse group of disorders. Trisomy 8, monosomy 7, and loss of Y chromosome are the most common cytogenetic abnormalities seen. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) likely develops from early clones with TET2...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The role of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in identifying mutations in the driver, epigenetic regulator, RNA splicing, and signaling pathway genes in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) has contributed substantially to our understanding of the disease pathogenesis as well as disease evolution. NGS aids in determining the clonal nature of the disease in a subset of these disorders where mutations in the driver genes are not detected. There is a paucity of real-world data on the utility of this...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease with an inflammatory phenotype with increasing prevalence in the elderly. Expanded population of mutant blood cells carrying somatic mutations is termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). The association between CHIP and COPD and its relevant effects on DNA methylation in aging are mainly unknown. Analyzing the deep-targeted amplicon sequencing from 125 COPD patients, we found enhanced incidence of CHIP mutations...]]></summary>
