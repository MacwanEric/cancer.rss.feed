        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CONCLUSIONS: POT1 mutations associated with long telomere length conferred a predisposition to a familial clonal hematopoiesis syndrome that was associated with a range of benign and malignant solid neoplasms. The risk of these phenotypes was mediated by extended cellular longevity and by the capacity to maintain telomeres over time. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).]]></summary>

The discovery of driver mutations in JAK2, CALR and MPL genes provided new insights into their pathogenesis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified additional somatic mutations, most frequently in epigenetic modulator genes. In this study, a cohort of 95 MPN patients was genetically characterized using targeted NGS. Clonal hierarchies of detected mutations were subsequently analysed using colony...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genetic predisposition has been shown to contribute substantially to the age at which we die. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have linked more than 20 loci to phenotypes related to human lifespan¹. However, little is known about how lifespan is impacted by gene loss of function. Through whole-exome sequencing of 352,338 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry, we assessed the relevance of protein-truncating variant (PTV) gene burden on individual and parental survival. We identified...]]></summary>

One contributing factor is the one-size-fits-all nature of multi-modal therapy.

These lesions are precursors for blood cancers^(2-6), but the basis of their fitness advantage remains largely unknown, partly owing to a paucity of large cohorts in which the clonal expansion rate has been assessed by longitudinal sampling. Here, to circumvent this limitation, we developed a method to infer the expansion rate from data from a single time point....]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both fatty bone marrow (FBM) and somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), also termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH) accumulate with human aging. However it remains unclear whether FBM can modify the evolution of CH. To address this question, we herein present the interaction between CH and FBM in two preclinical male mouse models: after sub-lethal irradiation or after castration. An adipogenesis inhibitor (PPARγ inhibitor) is used in both models as a control. A significant increase in...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DNA replication is a highly coordinated cell cycle process that can become dysregulated in cancer, increasing both proliferation and mutation rates. Single-cell whole genome sequencing holds potential for studying replication dynamics of cancer cells; however, computational methods for identifying S-phase cells and inferring single-cell replication timing profiles remain immature for samples with heterogeneous copy number. Here we report a new method, PERT, which jointly infers replication and...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, are a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) diseases. The incidence increases with global population aging. Genome sequencing uncovered mutational profiles in patients with myeloid malignancies and healthy elderly individuals. However, the molecular and cellular basis of disease development remains unclear. Accumulating evidence shows mitochondrial involvement in the pathogenesis of myeloid...]]></summary>

In this issue of Cancer Discovery, Akagi and colleagues characterize the remarkably complex landscape of virus-host DNA molecules in HPV-positive cells, providing evidence for diverse integrated and extrachromosomal virus-host hybrid DNAs with the potential to drive clonal evolution. See related article by Akagi et al., p. 910 (4).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Myelodysplastic neoplasm (MDS) represents a heterogeneous group of myeloid disorders that originate from the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that lead to the development of clonal hematopoiesis. MDS was characterized by an increased risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In recent years, with the aid of next-generation sequencing (NGS), an increasing number of molecular aberrations were discovered, such as recurrent mutations in FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, TP53, NRAS, and...]]></summary>

Reconstruction, aiming for correct variant clustering and clonal evolution tree reconstruction, is commonly performed by tedious manual work. While there is a plethora of tools to automatically generate reconstruction, their reliability, especially reasons for unreliability, are not...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CONCLUSIONS: There is emerging information on the diagnostic and prognostic value of CTCs in HNSCCs. Evidence also highlights the advantages of various downstream analysis approaches over circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), such as single-CTC analysis, ex vivo, and in vivo expansion of CTCs. Multiple phenotypic surface markers (cytokeratins, EpCAM, vimentin, etc.), used for CTCs characterization using different immunoassays, could predict disease progression as well as patients' response to treatment...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liquid biopsy is a diagnostic repeatable test, which in last years has emerged as a powerful tool for profiling cancer genomes in real-time with minimal invasiveness and tailoring oncological decision-making. It analyzes different blood-circulating biomarkers and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is the preferred one. Nevertheless, tissue biopsy remains the gold standard for molecular evaluation of solid tumors whereas liquid biopsy is a complementary tool in many different clinical settings, such...]]></summary>

Novel methods of quantifying spatial tumour data at the cellular scale are required to link evolutionary dynamics to the resulting spatial architecture of the tumour. Here, we propose a framework using first passage times of random walks to quantify the complex spatial patterns of tumour cell population...]]></summary>
