        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has fascinated the medical community for some time. Discovered about a decade ago, this phenomenon links age-related alterations in hematopoiesis not only to the later development of hematological malignancies but also to an increased risk of early-onset cardiovascular disease and some other disorders. CHIP is detected in the blood and is characterized by clonally expanded somatic mutations in cancer-associated genes, predisposing to the...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are an emerging therapy for refractory lymphomas. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the preferential outgrowth of mutated bone marrow progenitors, is enriched in lymphoma patients receiving CAR-T cells. CAR-T therapy requires conditioning chemotherapy and often induces systemic inflammatory reactions, both of which have been shown to promote expansion of CH clones. Thus, we hypothesized that pre-existing CH clones could expand during CAR-T cell treatment. We...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Myeloid neoplasms arise from pre-existing clonal hematopoiesis (CH), however the role of CH in pathogenesis of ALL is unknown. We found that 18% of adult ALL cases harbored TP53, and 16% had myeloid CH-associated gene mutations. ALL with myeloid mutations (MyM) had distinct genetic and clinical characteristics, associated with inferior survival. By using single cell proteogenomic analysis, we demonstrated that myeloid mutations were present years before the diagnosis of ALL, and a subset of...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JAK2V617F (JAK2VF) clonal hematopoiesis (CH) has been associated with atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). We assessed the impact of Jak2VF CH on arterial thrombosis and explored the underlying mechanisms. A meta-analysis of three large cohort studies confirmed the association of JAK2VF with CVD, and with platelet counts and adjusted mean platelet volume (MPV). In mice, 20% or 1.5% Jak2VF CH accelerated arterial thrombosis and increased platelet activation. Megakaryocytes in Jak2VF CH...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complexes exist in three subcomplexes: canonical BAF (cBAF), polybromo BAF (PBAF), and a newly described non-canonical BAF (ncBAF). While cBAF and PBAF regulate fates of multiple cell types, roles for ncBAF in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have not been investigated. Motivated by recent discovery of disrupted expression of BRD9, an essential component of ncBAF, in multiple cancers, including clonal hematopoietic disorders, we evaluate here the role of...]]></summary>

Using primary human samples and gene-editing to model isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutant pHSCs, we show epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic differences between pHSCs and healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We confirm that IDH1 driven clonal hematopoiesis is associated with...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of clonal hematopoietic neoplasms originating from hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs). We previously identified frequent roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1) mutations in patients with MDS, while the exact role of ROBO1 in hematopoiesis remains poorly delineated. Here, we report that ROBO1 deficiency confers MDS-like disease with anemia and multilineage dysplasia in mice and predicts poor prognosis in patients with MDS. More specifically,...]]></summary>

The driver mutations mainly include JAK2 mutations, CALR mutations and MPL mutations and non-driver mutations mainly include ASXL1, DNMT3A, TET2, SF3B1, EZH2, TP53, SRSF2, USAF1, etc. Driver and non-driver mutations and their clonal evolution affect the thrombosis and disease transformation of MPN. Clonal hematopoiesis of MPN can occur decades before diagnosis, even in the fetal stage....]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), also known as Ph^(-)MPN, includes polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Secondary myelofibrosis (sMF) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) are important disease progressions of MPN. After MPN disease progression, hematopoietic stem cells undergo new clonal evolution, leading to drug resistance, poor treatment effect and poor survival of patients. In recent years, the exploration of the...]]></summary>

Although some progress has been made in managing laryngeal cancer, the 5-year survival rate is disappointing. The gradual increase in the incidence of second primary tumors (SPTs) plays a crucial role in determining survival outcomes during long-term follow-up, and the esophagus was the most common site with a worse prognosis. In clinical practice, the treatment of esophageal second primary tumors...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Age-associated clonal hematopoiesis (CH) occurs due to somatic mutations accrued in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that confer a selective growth advantage in the context of aging. The mechanisms by which CH-mutant HSCs gain this advantage with aging are not comprehensively understood. Using unbiased transcriptomic approaches, we identified Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling as a candidate contributor to age-related Dnmt3a-mutant CH. We found that Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs from young adult mice (3-6 months...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The study of somatic mutations and the associated clonal mosaicism across the human body has transformed our understanding of ageing and its links to cancer. In proliferative human tissues, stem cells compete for dominance and those with an advantage expand clonally in relation to their peers. In the hematopoietic system, such expansion is termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH). The forces driving competition, namely heterogeneity of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool and attrition of the HSC...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common age-related phenomenon that occurs when hematopoietic stem cells acquire mutations in a select set of genes commonly mutated in myeloid neoplasia which then expand clonally. Current sequencing assays to detect CHIP are not optimized for the detection of these variants and can be cost-prohibitive when applied to large cohorts or serial sequencing. Here, we present and validate a CHIP targeted sequencing assay that is affordable...]]></summary>

Those with low-risk disease also suffer and die from MDS-related complications. Among the most challenging is development of anemia and transfusion dependence, which impacts quality of life and is associated with reduced survival. Appreciating and...]]></summary>
