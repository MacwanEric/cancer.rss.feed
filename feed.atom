        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, which is formed by a t (9;22)(q34;q11) translocation. The aberrant activation of the ABL1 tyrosine kinase is caused by the BCR::ABL1 fusion gene on the Ph chromosome, leading to significant leukemic cell proliferation. CML is typically diagnosed in the chronic phase with few clinical symptoms and progresses to a blast crisis within years. CML acquires additional genetic abnormalities...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The earliest events during human tumour initiation, although poorly characterized, may hold clues to malignancy detection and prevention¹. Here we model occult preneoplasia by biallelic inactivation of TP53, a common early event in gastric cancer, in human gastric organoids. Causal relationships between this initiating genetic lesion and resulting phenotypes were established using experimental evolution in multiple clonally derived cultures over 2 years. TP53 loss elicited progressive...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy of terminally differentiated plasma cells. The mechanisms of the pathogenesis and progression of MM include genetic abnormalities of the MM cells and the interaction between MM cells and bone marrow microenvironment (BMME). MM cells start malignant proliferation in BMME and contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of MM through direct or indirect interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. Exploring the mechanism of interaction...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is a driver of tumor evolution and a main cause of therapeutic resistance. Despite its importance, measures of ITH are still not incorporated into clinical practice. Consequently, standard treatment is frequently ineffective for patients with heterogeneous tumors as changes to treatment regimens are made only after recurrence and disease progression. More effective combination therapies require a mechanistic understanding of ITH and ways to assess it in clinical...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is the development of a certain cell lineage which is the cornerstone of hematologic malignancy especially myeloid neoplasms, however, can also be found in old age (6th-7th decade). CH is caused by many different somatic mutations most commonly in DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, SF3B1 and TP53. It is detected by different sequencing methods, the most commonly used ones are next generation sequencing (NGS) which can be whole exome, whole genome sequencing or a panel for certain...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Endometrial cancer belongs to the most common gynecologic cancer types globally, with increasing incidence. There are numerous ways of classifying different cases. The most recent decade has brought advances in molecular classification, which show more accurate prognostic factors and the possibility of personalised adjuvant treatment. In addition, diagnostic approaches lag behind these advances, with methods causing patients discomfort while lacking the reproducibility of tissue sampling for...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are characterized by distinct clinical phenotypes. The discovery of driver mutations in JAK2, CALR and MPL genes provided new insights into their pathogenesis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified additional somatic mutations, most frequently in epigenetic modulator genes. In this study, a cohort of 95 MPN patients was genetically characterized using targeted NGS. Clonal hierarchies of detected mutations were subsequently analysed using colony...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assays to detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have multiple clinically important applications in management of multiple types of gastrointestinal cancers. Different methodologies of ctDNA detection have varying sensitivities and potential applications in different contexts. For patients with localized cancers treated for curative intent, ctDNA detection is associated with prognosis in multiple cancer types, and persistent detection of ctDNA after surgical resection is highly concerning for...]]></summary>

Larger studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to investigate the association between RAI and clonal dynamics. The presence of CH is associated with worse structural progression in both BRAFV600E-mutant and wild-type thyroid cancers.]]></summary>
