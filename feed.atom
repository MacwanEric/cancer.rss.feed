        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present the first comprehensive investigation of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in 2,860 long-term survivors of pediatric cancer with a median follow-up time of 23.5 years. Deep-sequencing over 39 CH-related genes reveals mutations in 15% of the survivors, significantly higher than the 8.5% in 324 community controls. CH in survivors is associated with exposures to alkylating agents, radiation, and bleomycin. Therapy-related CH shows significant enrichment in STAT3, characterized as a CH-gene...]]></summary>

A well-documented chromosome configuration is the highly compacted chromosome structure during metaphase. More regional chromatin conformations have also been reported, including topologically associated domains encompassing mega-bases of DNA and local chromatin loops formed by kilo-bases of DNA. In this review, we discuss the changes in chromatin conformation taking place between somatic and meiotic cells, with a...]]></summary>

Once DNMTs produce 5-methylcytosine (5mC), TET proteins fine-tune the DNA methylation status by consecutively oxidizing 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and further oxidized derivatives. The 5mC and oxidized methylcytosines are essential for the maintenance of cellular identity and...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present the case of a 64-year-old man diagnosed with large B-cell lymphoma who relapsed twice after standard-of-care therapy. Due to persisting cytopenia, Next generation sequencing analysis was performed, revealing a small TP53-mutated clone. As a third-line therapy, the patient was treated with CAR-T cells, which resulted in complete remission. However, this treatment also led to the expansion of the TP53-mutated clone and therapy-related myelodysplasia with a complex aberrant karyotype....]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable hematologic malignancy characterized by a multistep evolutionary pathway, with an initial phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), potentially evolving into the symptomatic disease, often preceded by an intermediate phase called "smoldering" MM (sMM). From a biological point of view, genomic alterations (translocations/deletions/mutations) are already present at the MGUS phase, thus rendering their role in disease evolution...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is the age-related expansion of hematopoietic stem cell clones caused by the acquisition of somatic point mutations or mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs). Clonal hematopoiesis caused by somatic mutations has primarily been associated with increased risk of myeloid malignancies, while mCAs have been associated with increased risk of lymphoid malignancies. A recent study by Niroula et al. challenged this paradigm by finding a distinct subset of somatic mutations and...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was responsible for 1.2 million deaths globally in 2016. Despite the large and growing burden of CKD, treatment options are limited and generally only preserve kidney function. Characterizing molecular precursors to incident and progressive CKD could point to critically needed prevention and treatment strategies. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is typically characterized by the clonal expansion of blood cells carrying somatic mutations in...]]></summary>
