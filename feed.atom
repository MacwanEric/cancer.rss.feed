        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resistance towards cancer treatment represents a major clinical obstacle, preventing cure of cancer patients. To gain mechanistic insights, we developed a model for acquired resistance to chemotherapy by treating mice carrying patient derived xenografts (PDX) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with widely-used cytotoxic drugs for 18 consecutive weeks. In two distinct PDX samples, tumors initially responded to treatment, until stable disease and eventually tumor re-growth evolved under therapy, at...]]></summary>

However, the incidence of myeloid mutations other than the common JAK2 V617F mutation in unselected patients referred for elevated hemoglobin is not well studied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the capacity to renew blood cells at all stages of life and are largely quiescent at a steady state. It is essential to understand the processes that govern quiescence in HSCs to enhance bone marrow transplantation. It is hypothesized that in their quiescent state, HSCs primarily use glycolysis for energy production rather than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In addition, the HSC switch from quiescence to activation occurs along a continuous...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genetic and epigenetic variation, together with transcriptional plasticity, contribute to intratumour heterogeneity¹. The interplay of these biological processes and their respective contributions to tumour evolution remain unknown. Here we show that intratumour genetic ancestry only infrequently affects gene expression traits and subclonal evolution in colorectal cancer (CRC). Using spatially resolved paired whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, we find that the majority of intratumour...]]></summary>

However, DNA mutations alone do not fully explain malignant transformation^(4-7). Here we investigate the co-evolution of the genome and epigenome of colorectal tumours at single-clone resolution using spatial multi-omic profiling of individual glands. We collected 1,370 samples from 30 primary cancers and 8 concomitant adenomas and generated 1,207 chromatin accessibility...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The majority of human cancers evolve over time through the stepwise accumulation of somatic mutations followed by clonal selection akin to Darwinian evolution. However, the in-depth mechanisms that govern clonal dynamics and selection remain elusive, particularly during the earliest stages of tissue transformation. Cell competition, often referred to as 'survival of the fittest' at the cellular level, results in the elimination of less fit cells by their more fit neighbors supporting optimal...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The family of ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases (TETs) consists of TET1, TET2, and TET3. Although all TETs are expressed in hematopoietic tissues, only TET2 is commonly found to be mutated in age-related clonal hematopoiesis and hematopoietic malignancies. TET2 mutation causes abnormal epigenetic landscape changes and results in multiple stages of lineage commitment/differentiation defects as well as genetic instability in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). TET2 mutations are...]]></summary>

These mutations can facilitate clonal expansion and may contribute to malignant transformation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis, especially that of indeterminate potential (CHIP), has been associated with age-related diseases, such as those contributing to a more severe COVID-19. Four studies have attempted to associate CHIP with COVID-19 severity without conclusive findings. In the present work, we explore the association between CHIP and COVID-19 mortality. Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients (n = 241 deceased, n = 239 survivors) was sequenced with the Myeloid...]]></summary>

The role of ARCH in lymphoid leukemogenesis is unknown. We hypothesize that ARCH is a precursor lesion for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in older adults, and ARCH-associated ALL is a unique entity with different molecular and clinical characteristics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Molecular diagnostics inhabit an increasingly central role in characterizing hematopoietic malignancies. This brief review summarizes the genomic targets important for many major categories of hematopoietic neoplasia by focusing on disease pathogenesis. In myeloid disease, recurrent mutations in key functional classes drive clonal hematopoiesis, on which additional variants can specify clinical presentation and accelerate progression. Lymphoblastic leukemias are frequently initiated by oncogenic...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BACKGROUND: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a fairly newly described phenomenon characterized by myeloid cancer-associated somatic mutations detectable in the peripheral blood of individuals without evidence of hematologic disease. Individuals with CHIP have a significantly increased risk of developing a hematologic malignancy, although the overall rate of transformation is low.]]></summary>

Aging is associated with a gradual decline of the self-renewal and regenerative potential of HSCs and with the development of clonal hematopoiesis. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) defines the clonal expansion of genetically variant hematopoietic cells bearing one or more gene mutations and/or structural variants (such as copy number alterations)....]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The extensive spatial genomic intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in liver cancer hindered treatment development and limited biomarker design. Early events that drive tumor malignant transformation in tumor founder cells are clonally present in all tumor cell populations, which provide stable biomarkers for the localization of tumor cells and patients' prognosis. In the present study, we identified the recurrently clonal somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) (893 clonal somatic...]]></summary>

Most HAL cases have various degrees of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and exhibit a similar origin and clonal evolution process to HCC. We studied a case of HAL without elevating the AFP level by performing whole-exome sequencing (WES) and bioinformatics analyses...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly diverse disease, where different genomic instability pathways shape genetic clonal diversity and tumor microenvironment. Although intra-tumor heterogeneity has been characterized in primary tumors, its origin and consequences in CRC outcome is not fully understood. Therefore, we assessed intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity of a prospective cohort of 136 CRC samples. We demonstrate that CRC diversity is forged by asynchronous forms of molecular alterations,...]]></summary>
