        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Age is a predominant risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI), yet the biological mechanisms underlying this risk are largely unknown. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) confers increased risk for several chronic diseases associated with aging. Here we sought to test whether CHIP increases the risk of AKI. In three population-based epidemiology cohorts, we found that CHIP was associated with a greater risk of incident AKI, which was more pronounced in patients with AKI...]]></summary>

CH in the setting of autologous transplant is enriched for mutations in DNA damage response pathway genes and is associated with adverse outcomes, including an increased risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm and inferior overall survival. Studies of CH in allogeneic transplant donors...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal expansion refers to the proliferation and selection of advantageous "clones" that are better suited for survival in a Darwinian manner. In recent years, we have greatly enhanced our understanding of cell clonality in the cardiovascular context. However, our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms behind this clonal selection is still severely limited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that metastatic driver mutations are sequentially acquired and selected within the same clonal lineage both before, but more commonly after, dissemination from the primary tumor, and that these mutations are biologically consequential. Despite inherent limitations in sampling archival primary tumors, our findings indicate that tumor cells in most patients continue to undergo clinically relevant genomic evolution after their dissemination from the primary...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an entity hallmarked by skewed hematopoiesis with persistent overrepresentation of cells from a common stem/progenitor lineage harboring single-nucleotide variants and/or insertions/deletions. CH is a common and age-related phenomenon that is associated with an increased risk of hematological malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. While CH is a term of the hematological aspect, there exists a complex interaction with other organ systems,...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alterations in epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, represent a hallmark of cancer that has been successfully exploited for therapy in myeloid malignancies. Hypomethylating agents (HMA), such as azacitidine, have become standard-of-care therapy to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloid neoplasms that can evolve into acute myeloid leukemia. However, our capacity to identify who will respond to HMAs, and the duration of response, remains limited. To shed light on this question, we...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Systemic mastocytosis is defined by the clonal proliferation of abnormal mast cells. The clinical course can range from indolent forms with normal life expectancy to advanced mast cell leukemia with dismal prognosis. An association with other diseases, including myeloproliferative neoplasia, has been described. We present a case of a 75-year patient with a history of cutaneous mastocytosis who was diagnosed with mast cell leukemia more than 9 years ago and did not receive treatment.
