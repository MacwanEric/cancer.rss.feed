        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both aging and reduced diversity at the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) level are ubiquitous. What remains unclear is why some individuals develop clonal hematopoiesis (CH), and why does CH due to specific mutations occur in specific individuals. Much like aging, reduced diversity of HSCs is a complex phenotype shaped by numerous factors (germline & environment). The purpose of the current review is to discuss the role of two other age-related ubiquitous processes that might...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T)-cell therapy has become a standard treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL). Mutations in the PPM1D gene, a frequent driver alteration in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), lead to a gain of function of PPM1D/Wip1 phosphatase, impairing p53-dependent G1 checkpoint and promoting cell proliferation. The presence of PPM1D mutations has been correlated with reduced response to standard chemotherapy in lymphoma...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal lineage inference ("tumor phylogenetics") has become a crucial tool for making sense of somatic evolution processes that underlie cancer development and are increasingly recognized as part of normal tissue growth and aging. The inference of clonal lineage trees from single cell sequence data offers particular promise for revealing processes of somatic evolution in unprecedented detail. However, most such tools are based on fairly restrictive models of the types of mutation events observed...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evolvability is an emergent hallmark of cancer that depends on intra-tumor heterogeneity and, ultimately, genetic variation. Mutations generated by APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases can contribute to genetic variation and the consequences of APOBEC activation differ depending on the stage of cancer, with the most significant impact observed during the early stages. However, how APOBEC activity shapes evolutionary patterns of genes in the host genome and differential impacts on cancer-associated and...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complexes exist in three subcomplexes: canonical BAF (cBAF), polybromo BAF (PBAF), and a newly described non-canonical BAF (ncBAF). While cBAF and PBAF regulate fates of multiple cell types, roles for ncBAF in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have not been investigated. Motivated by recent discovery of disrupted expression of BRD9, an essential component of ncBAF, in multiple cancers, including clonal hematopoietic disorders, we evaluate here the role of...]]></summary>

MDS are a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell diseases characterized by cytopenia(s), dysplasia in one or more of lineages, ineffective hematopoiesis, and an increased risk of progression to bone marrow failure or to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Current NCCN guidelines and recent review articles...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obesity has taken the face of a pandemic with less direct concern among the general population and scientific community. However, obesity is considered a low-grade systemic inflammation that impacts multiple organs. Chronic inflammation is also associated with different solid and blood cancers. In addition, emerging evidence demonstrates that individuals with obesity are at higher risk of developing blood cancers and have poorer clinical outcomes than individuals in a normal weight range.

Indeed, HF and cancer share common risk factors, including aging and unhealthy lifestyles, and underlying mechanisms, including activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, chronic inflammation, and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a heterogeneous group of hematologic malignancies characterized by an abnormal proliferation of cells of the myeloid lineage. Affected individuals are at increased risk for cardiovascular and thrombotic events. Myocardial infarction (MI) may be one of the earliest clinical manifestations of MPNs or may be a thrombotic complication that develops during the natural course of the disease. In the present review, we examine the epidemiology, pathogenesis,...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hematopoiesis is an essential process for organismal development and homeostasis. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is critical for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in normal hematopoiesis. Increasing evidence shows that disrupting the balance between self-renewal and cell fate decisions can give rise to hematological diseases such as bone marrow failure and leukemia. Consequently, next-generation sequencing studies have identified various aberrations in histone modifications,...]]></summary>

Poor survival and refractoriness to current treatment strategies characterize affected patients from a clinical point of view. In our aging societies, where newer therapies and ameliorated cancer management protocols are improving the life expectancy of cancer patients, therapy-related Myeloid Neoplasms are an emerging problem.

Specifically, two lymphoma subtypes arise from germinal centers (GCs), namely follicular lymphoma (FL) and GC B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL). In addition to recent advances in describing the genetic landscape of FL and GCB-DLBCL, tumor microenvironment (TME) has progressively emerged as a central determinant of early...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acidosis is a chemical signature of the tumour microenvironment that challenges intracellular pH homeostasis. The orchestrated activity of acid-base transporters of the solute-linked carrier (SLC) family is critical for removing the end-products of fermentative metabolism (lactate/H^(+)) and maintaining a favourably alkaline cytoplasm. Given the critical role of pH homeostasis in enabling cellular activities, mutations in relevant SLC genes may impact the oncogenic process, emerging as...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple myeloma (MM) is a genetically complex hematological cancer characterized by the abnormal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. This disease progresses from a premalignant condition known as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) through sequential genetic alterations involving various genes. These genetic changes contribute to the uncontrolled growth of multiple clones of plasma cells. In this study, we present a phenotype-structured model that...]]></summary>

The prevalence of CH increases dramatically with age. CH can be caused by somatic mutations in individual genes or by gains and or losses of larger chromosomal segments. CH is a premalignant state; the somatic mutations detected in CH are the initiating mutations for hematologic malignancies, and CH is a strong predictor for the development...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) remains a key treatment option for hematologic malignancies (HMs), although it carries significant risks. Up to 30% of patients relapse after allo-HSCT, of which 2-5% are donor-derived malignancies (DDM). DDM can arise from a germline genetic predisposition allele or clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in the donor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The development of cancer begins with cells transitioning from their multicellular nature to a state akin to unicellular organisms. This shift leads to a breakdown in the crucial regulators inherent to multicellularity, resulting in the emergence of diverse cancer cell subpopulations that have enhanced adaptability. The presence of different cell subpopulations within a tumour, known as intratumoural heterogeneity (ITH), poses challenges for cancer treatment. In this review, we delve into the...]]></summary>
