        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although immunotherapy with PD-(L)1 blockade is routine for lung cancer, little is known about acquired resistance. Among 1,201 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with PD-(L)1 blockade, acquired resistance is common, occurring in >60% of initial responders. Acquired resistance shows differential expression of inflammation and interferon (IFN) signaling. Relapsed tumors can be separated by upregulated or stable expression of IFNγ response genes. Upregulation of IFNγ response...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JAK2-V617F is the most frequent somatic mutation causing myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). JAK2-V617F can be found in healthy individuals with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) with a frequency much higher than the prevalence of MPN. The factors controlling the conversion of JAK2-V617F CHIP to MPN are largely unknown. We hypothesized that IL-1β mediated inflammation can favor this progression. We established an experimental system using bone marrow (BM) transplantations...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RATIONALE: Hematological malignancies have always been a challenge for scientists because there is a constant need to better define these entities. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. Cytogenetics and molecular findings are a prerequisite for these syndromes as they confirm the clonal nature of the disease. However, MDS is often linked to autoimmunity and inflammation as part of its pathogenesis. Recently, VEXAS syndrome...]]></summary>

This testing model relies on tumour BRCA1/2 tests being able to detect all types of pathogenic variant. We analysed germline and tumour BRCA1/2 test results from patients treated for epithelial ovarian cancer at our specialist oncological referral centre.

Large-scale tumour genomic characterization has accurately classified malignant melanoma into four different genomic subtypes so far. Despite this, only somatic mutations in BRAF oncogene, as assessed in tumour biopsies, has so far become a validated predictive biomarker of treatment with small...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP), the clonal expansion of myeloid cells with leukemogenic mutations, results in increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. CHIP is more prevalent among people with HIV (PWH) but the risk factors are unknown. CHIP was identified among PWH in REPRIEVE (Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV) using whole exome sequencing (WES). Logistic regression was used to associate sociodemographic factors and HIV-specific factors with CHIP...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Myeloid neoplasms arise from pre-existing clonal hematopoiesis (CH), however the role of CH in pathogenesis of ALL is unknown. We found that 18% of adult ALL cases harbored TP53, and 16% had myeloid CH-associated gene mutations. ALL with myeloid mutations (MyM) had distinct genetic and clinical characteristics, associated with inferior survival. By using single cell proteogenomic analysis, we demonstrated that myeloid mutations were present years before the diagnosis of ALL, and a subset of...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are an emerging therapy for refractory lymphomas. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the preferential outgrowth of mutated bone marrow progenitors, is enriched in lymphoma patients receiving CAR-T cells. CAR-T therapy requires conditioning chemotherapy and often induces systemic inflammatory reactions, both of which have been shown to promote expansion of CH clones. Thus, we hypothesized that pre-existing CH clones could expand during CAR-T cell treatment. We...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JAK2V617F (JAK2VF) clonal hematopoiesis (CH) has been associated with atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). We assessed the impact of Jak2VF CH on arterial thrombosis and explored the underlying mechanisms. A meta-analysis of three large cohort studies confirmed the association of JAK2VF with CVD, and with platelet counts and adjusted mean platelet volume (MPV). In mice, 20% or 1.5% Jak2VF CH accelerated arterial thrombosis and increased platelet activation. Megakaryocytes in Jak2VF CH...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complexes exist in three subcomplexes: canonical BAF (cBAF), polybromo BAF (PBAF), and a newly described non-canonical BAF (ncBAF). While cBAF and PBAF regulate fates of multiple cell types, roles for ncBAF in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have not been investigated. Motivated by recent discovery of disrupted expression of BRD9, an essential component of ncBAF, in multiple cancers, including clonal hematopoietic disorders, we evaluate here the role of...]]></summary>

Using primary human samples and gene-editing to model isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutant pHSCs, we show epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic differences between pHSCs and healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We confirm that IDH1 driven clonal hematopoiesis is associated with...]]></summary>
