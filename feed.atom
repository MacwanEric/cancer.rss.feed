        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a clonal hematopoietic neoplasm characterized by bone marrow dysplasia, failure of hematopoiesis and variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recent large-scale studies have demonstrated that distinct molecular abnormalities detected at earlier stages of MDS alter disease biology and predict progression to AML. Consistently, various studies analyzing these diseases at the single-cell level have identified specific patterns of progression...]]></summary>

Current classifications are based on the presence of genetic predisposition and MDS post-cytotoxic therapy (MDS-pCT) etiologies. However, since these risk factors are not exclusive for secondary MDSs and there are multiple overlapping scenarios, a comprehensive and definitive classification is yet to come. In addition, a sporadic MDS might arise after a...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background High-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSCs) display a high degree of complex genetic alterations. In this study, we identified germline and somatic genetic alterations in HGSC and their association with relapse-free and overall survival. Using a targeted capture of 577 genes involved in DNA damage response and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, we conducted next-generation sequencing of DNA from matched blood and tumor tissue from 71 HGSC participants. In addition, we performed the OncoScan assay...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CONCLUSIONS: IDH1/2 mutations are most frequently accompanied by DNMT3A, SRSF2 and NPM1 mutations. NPM1-IDH1/2 mutated AML has a mature phenotype possibly amenable to differentiation therapies. IDH1/2 and SRSF2 mutations probably arise at the same developmental stage of the disease, as their allele burdens covariate. IDH1/2 mutation represents CHIP in a substantial proportion of cases and is therefore no reliable residual disease marker. The preferential presence of IDH1/2 mutations among...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Somatic mutations, described as noninherited changes in DNA that arise and are passed on to descendant cells, are well known to cause cancers; however, it is increasingly appreciated that the propagation of somatic mutations within a tissue may have a role in causing nonneoplastic disorders and abnormalities in elderly individuals. The nonmalignant clonal expansion of somatic mutations in the hematopoietic system is termed clonal hematopoiesis. This review will briefly discuss...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a prevalent condition that results from the acquisition of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells. When these mutations occur in "driver" genes, they can potentially confer fitness advantages to the cell, leading to a clonal expansion. While most clonal expansions of mutant cells are generally considered to be asymptomatic since they do not impact overall blood cell numbers, CH carriers display long-term risks of all-cause mortality and...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein initiated the success story of targeted therapies in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, is currently indicated as first-line therapy in patients with NSCLC with sensitizing EGFR mutations, as second-line therapy in patients who present the resistance-associated mutation T790M after treatment with previous EGFR-TKIs, and as adjuvant...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Women diagnosed with non-mucinous high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in England are often reflex-tested for germline and tumour BRCA1/2 variants. The value of germline BRCA1/2 testing in women diagnosed aged ≥80 is questionable. We performed an observational study of all women diagnosed with non-mucinous high-grade EOC who underwent germline and tumour BRCA1/2 testing by the North West of England Genomic Laboratory Hub. A subgroup of women also underwent germline testing using a panel of...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although the gross and microscopic features of squamous cell carcinoma arising from ovarian mature cystic teratoma (MCT-SCC) vary from case to case, the spatially spreading of genomic alterations within the tumor remains unclear. To clarify the spatial genomic diversity in MCT-SCCs, we performed whole-exome sequencing by collecting 16 samples from histologically different parts of two MCT-SCCs. Both cases showed histological diversity within the tumors (case 1: nonkeratinizing and keratinizing...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lineage tracing using fluorescent proteins, genetic barcodes, and various other strategies have provided critical insights into the dynamics of both fetal and adult hematopoiesis in model organisms. However, these technologies cannot be readily utilized to study hematopoiesis in humans. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop strategies to assess cellular dynamics within human hematopoietic tissues in vivo. Recently, researchers have utilized naturally acquired somatic mutations, coupled...]]></summary>
