        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) of the autosomes, X, and Y chromosomes are aging-related somatic mutations detectable in peripheral blood. The presence of these acquired mutations predisposes otherwise healthy adults to increased risk of several chronic aging-related conditions including hematologic cancers, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, other inflammatory conditions, and mortality. While the public health impact and...]]></summary>

Treatment combining all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) has dramatically improved the prognosis of APL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) leads to higher mortality, carries a cardiovascular risk and alters inflammation. All three aspects harbor overlaps with the clinical manifestation of COVID-19. This study aimed to identify the impact of CHIP on COVID-19 pathophysiology. 90 hospitalized patients were analyzed for CHIP. In addition, their disease course and outcome were evaluated. With a prevalence of 37.8%, the frequency of a CHIP-driver mutation was significantly higher...]]></summary>

There is strong evidence suggesting that individual tumor foci can arise as genetically distinct, clonally independent lesions. However, recent studies have also demonstrated that adjacent Gleason pattern (GP) 3 and GP4 lesions can originate from the same clone but follow divergent genetic and morphologic evolution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Since the identification of JAK2 V617F and exon 12 mutations as driver mutations in polycythemia vera (PV) in 2005, molecular testing of these mutations for patients with erythrocytosis has become a routine clinical practice. However, the incidence of myeloid mutations other than the common JAK2 V617F mutation in unselected patients referred for elevated hemoglobin is not well studied. This study aimed to characterize the mutational landscape in a real-world population of patients...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the capacity to renew blood cells at all stages of life and are largely quiescent at a steady state. It is essential to understand the processes that govern quiescence in HSCs to enhance bone marrow transplantation. It is hypothesized that in their quiescent state, HSCs primarily use glycolysis for energy production rather than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In addition, the HSC switch from quiescence to activation occurs along a continuous...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are widely used in cancer research to edit specific genes and study their functions. This applies both to in vitro and in vivo studies where CRISPR technology has accelerated the generation of specific loss- or gain-of-function mutations. This review focuses on CRISPR for generating in vivo models of cancer by editing somatic cells in specific organs. The delivery of CRISPR/Cas to designated tissues and specific cell compartments...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inadequate mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is a limiting factor to proceed with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT). To assess the impact of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) on mobilization failure of PBPC for auto-HCT, we investigated the characteristics of poor mobilizers (with total PBPC collection <2x106 CD34+ cells/kg) in a consecutive single center cohort of 776 patients. Targeted error corrected next-generation sequencing of 28 genes was performed in...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is well documented that multiple myeloma (MM) originates in a single plasma cell transformed by chromosome 14q translocations or chromosomal hyperdiploidy and evolves with the accumulation of point mutations of driver genes and/or cytogenetic abnormalities. Furthermore, disease progression is accomplished by branching patterns of subclonal evolution from reservoir clones with a propagating potential and/or the emergence of minor clones, which already exist at premalignant stages and...]]></summary>
