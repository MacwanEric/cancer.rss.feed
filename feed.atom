        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is distinguished by clonal growth of myeloid precursor cells, which impairs normal hematopoiesis. Minimal residual disease (MRD) refers to the residual leukemia cells that persist after chemotherapy. Patients who test positive for MRD have a higher likelihood of experiencing a recurrence, regardless of the specific chemotherapy approach used. Multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are commonly...]]></summary>

Out of these, JAK2 V617F is mostly common. These mutations are thought to be mutually exclusive; therefore, the initial workup may not include the identification of all mutations separately.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an entity hallmarked by skewed hematopoiesis with persistent overrepresentation of cells from a common stem/progenitor lineage harboring single-nucleotide variants and/or insertions/deletions. CH is a common and age-related phenomenon that is associated with an increased risk of hematological malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. While CH is a term of the hematological aspect, there exists a complex interaction with other organ systems,...]]></summary>

Circulating Tumour Cells (CTCs) can provide important real-time insights into tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution, making them an important tool for early diagnosis and patient monitoring. Isolated CTCs are typically identified by immunocytochemistry using positive biomarkers (cytokeratin) and exclusion biomarkers (CD45).

We found that 18% of adult ALL cases harbored TP53, and 16% had myeloid CH-associated gene mutations. ALL with myeloid mutations (MyM) had distinct genetic and clinical characteristics, associated with inferior survival. By using single cell proteogenomic analysis, we demonstrated that myeloid mutations were present years before the diagnosis of ALL, and a subset of...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are rare hematologic disorders characterized by clonal hematopoiesis. Familial clustering is observed in a subset of cases, with a notable proportion exhibiting heterozygous germline mutations in DNA double-strand break repair genes (e.g., BRCA1). We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting BRCA1 haploinsufficiency alongside the JAK2V617F driver mutation. We assessed the efficacy of combining the PARP inhibitor olaparib with interferon-alpha (IFNα)...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T)-cell therapy has become a standard treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL). Mutations in the PPM1D gene, a frequent driver alteration in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), lead to a gain of function of PPM1D/Wip1 phosphatase, impairing p53-dependent G1 checkpoint and promoting cell proliferation. The presence of PPM1D mutations has been correlated with reduced response to standard chemotherapy in lymphoma...]]></summary>
