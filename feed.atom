Primarily, these entities result from germline variants in the globin gene clusters and their cis-acting regulatory elements, and thus the WHO classifies thalassemias as inherited diseases.

Serial observations infer weak selection indicating variants are acquired much earlier in life with unexplained initial growth spurts. Here we use fluctuating CpG methylation as a lineage marker to track stem cell clonal dynamics of hematopoiesis. We show, via the shared prenatal circulation of monozygotic twins, that weak selection conferred by stem cell variation...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time always leaves its mark, and our genome is no exception. Mutations in the genome of somatic cells were first hypothesized to be the cause of aging in the 1950s, shortly after the molecular structure of DNA had been described. Somatic mutation theories of aging are based on the fact that mutations in DNA as the ultimate template for all cellular functions are irreversible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) constitutes a B-cell neoplasm derived from germinal center lymphocytes. Despite high cure rates (80-90%) obtained with the current multiagent protocols, a significant proportion of cHL patients experience recurrences, characterized by a lower sensitivity to second-line treatments. The genomic background of chemorefractory cHL is still poorly understood, limiting personalized treatment strategies based on molecular features. In this study, using a targeted...]]></summary>

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) confers increased risk for several chronic diseases associated with aging. Here we sought to test whether CHIP increases the risk of AKI. In three population-based epidemiology cohorts, we found that CHIP was associated with a greater risk of incident AKI, which was more pronounced in patients with AKI...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Age is a predominant risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI), yet the biological mechanisms underlying this risk are largely unknown. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) confers increased risk for several chronic diseases associated with aging. Here we sought to test whether CHIP increases the risk of AKI. In three population-based epidemiology cohorts, we found that CHIP was associated with a greater risk of incident AKI, which was more pronounced in patients with AKI...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce all blood cells throughout the life of the organism. However, the high self-renewal and longevity of HSCs predispose them to accumulate mutations. The acquired mutations drive preleukemic clonal hematopoiesis, which is frequent among elderly people. The preleukemic state, although often asymptomatic, increases the risk of blood cancers. Nevertheless, the direct role of preleukemic HSCs is well-evidenced in adult myeloid leukemia (AML), while their...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is arguably the most lethal human malignancy. It often co-occurs with differentiated thyroid cancers, yet the molecular origins of its aggressivity are unknown. We sequenced tumor DNA from 329 regions of thyroid cancer, including 213 from patients with primary anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. We also whole genome sequenced 9 patients using multi-region sequencing of both differentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancer components. Using these data, we demonstrate...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CONCLUSION: Our findings of increased CHIP in BSyn probands and carriers suggest that one or two germline pathogenic variants in BLM could be sufficient to increase the risk of clonal hematopoiesis. These findings warrant further studies in larger cohorts to determine the significance of CHIP as a potential biomarker of aging, cancer, cardiovascular disease, morbidity and mortality.]]></summary>

All three epigenetic modifications are intermediates in DNA demethylation. TET proteins are recruited by transcription factors and by RNA polymerase II to modify 5mC at enhancers and gene bodies, thereby regulating gene expression during...]]></summary>

A variety of stressors drive this phenomenon, sometimes independent of age-related processes. For the purposes of this review, we adopt the term clonal hematopoiesis in predisposed individuals (CHIPI) to differentiate it from classical, age-related clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Stress-induced CHIPI selection can be extrinsic, such as following immunologic,...]]></summary>

Here, we present CNAqc, an evolution-inspired method to perform the computational validation of clonal and subclonal CNAs detected from bulk DNA sequencing. CNAqc is validated using single-cell data and simulations, is applied to over 4000 TCGA and PCAWG samples, and is...]]></summary>
