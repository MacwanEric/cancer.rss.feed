        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurate detection of somatic mutations in genetically heterogeneous tumor cell populations using next-generation sequencing remains challenging. We have developed MuSE, Mutation calling using a Markov Substitution model for Evolution, a novel approach for modeling the evolution of the allelic composition of tumor and normal tissue at each reference base. It adopts a sample-specific error model to depict inter-tumor heterogeneity, which greatly improves the overall accuracy. Here, we describe...]]></summary>

When the clone carries a pathogenic variant, it may be important to differentiate between somatic or germline origin. The variant in the blood that has a lower minor allele frequency could reflect heterozygous germline origin, somatic mosaicism, and clonal hematopoiesis. It is important to evaluate suspected variants to determine the course...]]></summary>

When the clone carries a pathogenic variant, it may be important to differentiate between somatic or germline origin. The variant in the blood that has a lower minor allele frequency could reflect heterozygous germline origin, somatic mosaicism, and clonal hematopoiesis.

Deficiencies in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway can lead to defective DNA damage responses, and this can occur through inherited germline mutations in HR pathway genes, such as CHEK2 and ATM. We now understand that germline mutations can be identified frequently (~ 5-10%) in patients with myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, and among the most...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intratumoral heterogeneity arising from tumor evolution poses significant challenges biologically and clinically. Dissecting this complexity may benefit from deep learning (DL) algorithms, which can infer molecular features from ubiquitous H&E stained tissue sections. While DL algorithms have been developed to predict some driver mutations from H&E images, the ability of these DL algorithms to resolve intratumoral mutation heterogeneity at sub-clonal spatial resolution is unexplored. Here, we...]]></summary>

Although bulk tumor genomic analyses have provided some insight into these processes, single-cell sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique to profile individual cells in unprecedented detail. Since the introduction of single-cell RNA sequencing, we now have the capability to capture not only transcriptomic, but also genomic, epigenetic, and...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Telomere biology was first studied in maize, ciliates, yeast, and mice, and in recent decades, it has informed understanding of common disease mechanisms with broad implications for patient care. Short telomere syndromes are the most prevalent premature aging disorders, with prominent phenotypes affecting the lung and hematopoietic system. Less understood are a newly recognized group of cancer-prone syndromes that are associated with mutations that lengthen telomeres. A large body of new data...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The epigenetic modifier histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) is frequently dysregulated in colon cancer cells. Microsatellite instability (MSI), an unfaithful replication of DNA at nucleotide repeats, occurs in about 15% of human colon tumors. MSI promotes a genetic frameshift and consequently a loss of HDAC2 in up to 43% of these tumors. We show that long-term and short-term cultures of colorectal cancers with MSI contain subpopulations of cells lacking HDAC2. These can be isolated as single...]]></summary>
