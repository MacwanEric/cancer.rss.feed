        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of leukemia in adults, leading to the highest number of annual leukemia-associated deaths in the USA. Although most AML patients initially enter remission following induction therapy, most eventually relapse, underscoring the unmet need for more effective therapies. In recent years, novel high-throughput sequencing techniques, and mouse and human models of disease have increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to AML....]]></summary>

In these 3 subtypes, an expansion of clonal cytotoxic T cells is often detected. In addition, those T cells recurrently harbor somatic mutations of...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by insufficient blood cell production and increased risk of transformation to myeloid malignancies. While genetically diverse, IBMFS are collectively defined by a cell-intrinsic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fitness defect that impairs HSC self-renewal and hematopoietic differentiation. In IBMFS, HSCs frequently acquire mutations that improve cell fitness, a phenomenon known as somatic...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inherited and acquired mutations in hematopoietic stem cells can cause clonal expansion with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a condition known for the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Inherited genetic variants in two CHIP-associated genome loci, the telomerase gene telomerase enzyme reverse transcriptase (TERT) (rs7705526) and the epigenetic regulator ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) (rs2454206), were investigated in 1001 patients with stable coronary...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest ITH as a potential unfavorable prognostic factor in PTC and highlight the dynamic changes in different clinical stages of PTC, providing some clues for the precision medicine and suggesting different diagnostic decisions depending on the clinical stages of patients. Finally, complete clear guidelines to define risk stratification of PTC patients are lacking; thus, this work could contribute to defining patients who need more aggressive treatments and, in turn,...]]></summary>
