        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recurrent mutations in RNA splicing proteins and epigenetic regulators contribute to the development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and related myeloid neoplasms. In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), SRSF2 mutations occur in ~50% of patients and TET2 mutations in ~60%. Clonal analysis indicates that either mutation can arise as the founder lesion. Based on human cancer genetics we crossed an inducible Srsf2^(P95H/+) mutant model with Tet2^(fl/fl) mice to mutate both concomitantly in...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms defined by a numerical increase and accumulation of clonal mast cells (MCs) in various organ systems. The disease may present as cutaneous mastocytosis or systemic mastocytosis (SM). On the basis of histopathological and molecular features, clinical variables, and organ involvement, SM is divided into indolent SM, smoldering SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, aggressive SM, and MC leukemia. Each variant is defined by unique...]]></summary>

Although all TETs are expressed in hematopoietic tissues, only TET2 is commonly found to be mutated in age-related clonal hematopoiesis and hematopoietic malignancies. TET2 mutation causes abnormal epigenetic landscape changes and results in multiple stages of lineage commitment/differentiation defects as well as genetic instability in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). TET2 mutations are...]]></summary>

MDS are usually seen in patients over 60 years of age and are accompanied by decreased ability of HSC to differentiate and enter apoptosis, producing bone marrow with increased cellularity conditioned by ineffective hematopoiesis and a degree of peripheral cytopenia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), an emerging biomarker for personalized risk-directed interventions, has increased prevalence in cancer survivors. Little is known about patients' preferences regarding CHIP testing. We surveyed participants in an ongoing prospective cohort study of young women with breast cancer (BC). The emailed survey included an introduction to CHIP and a clinical vignette eliciting participants' preferences for CHIP testing considering sequentially: 1)...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sleepless night may feel awful in its aftermath, but sleep's revitalizing powers are substantial, perpetuating the idea that convalescent sleep is a consequence-free physiological reset. Although recent studies have shown that catch-up sleep insufficiently neutralizes the negative effects of sleep debt, the mechanisms that control prolonged effects of sleep disruption are not understood. Here, we show that sleep interruption restructures the epigenome of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chromosomal instability is a common feature in malignant tumors. Previous studies have indicated that inactivation of the classical tumor suppressor genes RB1, CDKN2A, and TP53 may contribute to chromosomal aberrations in cancer by disrupting different aspects of the cell cycle and DNA damage checkpoint machinery. We performed a side-by-side comparison of how inactivation of each of these genes affected chromosomal stability in vitro. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, RB1, CDKN2A, and TP53 were...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LGL disorders are rare hematological neoplasias with remarkable phenotypic, genotypic and clinical heterogeneity. Despite these constraints, many achievements have been recently accomplished in understanding the aberrant pathways involved in the LGL leukemogenesis. In particular, compelling evidence implicates STAT signaling as a crucial player of the abnormal cell survival. As interest increases in mapping hematological malignancies by molecular genetics, the relevance of STAT gene mutations in...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The azanucleosides decitabine and azacytidine are used widely in the treatment of myeloid neoplasia and increasingly in the context of combination therapies. Although they were long regarded as being largely interchangeable in their function as hypomethylating agents, the azanucleosides actually have different mechanisms of action; decitabine interferes primarily with the methylation of DNA and azacytidine with that of RNA. Here, we examine the role of DNA methylation in the lineage commitment...]]></summary>
