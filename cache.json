          "description": "Liquid biopsies are the detection of molecular information in fluids from patients with cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the most promising liquid biopsy strategy is the use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from plasma. In early-stage CRC, the potential for ctDNA to impact care stems from the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) to guide adjuvant therapy after curative intent treatment and in identifying recurrences during surveillance. As for any new diagnostic test, ctDNA assays must...",

Indeed, HSCs easily differentiate in conventional culture systems, and in vitro study of stem cell biology, leukemogenesis, and evolutionary trajectories is limited. 3D-culture systems can mimic tissue architecture and microenvironment thus preserving HSC phenotype. In this study, we developed a calcium alginate...",

Here we use exome sequence data on 628,388 individuals to identify 40,208 carriers of clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Using genome-wide and exome-wide association analyses, we identify 24 loci (21 of which are novel) where germline genetic variation influences predisposition to CHIP, including missense variants in the...",

          "description": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal disorders originated by the serial acquisition of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The major clinical entities are represented by polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), that are caused by driver mutations affecting JAK2, MPL or CALR. Disease progression is related to molecular and clonal evolution. PV and ET can progress to secondary myelofibrosis (sMF) but can also evolve to...",

Currently, it is not clear if these hallmarks are random processes associated only with genome instability or are programmatically linked. Our goal was to elucidate this via a thorough bioinformatics analysis of 1474 GG genes in the context of WGD. We examined their association in protein-protein interaction and coexpression networks,...",

To metastasise, cancer cells must acquire the ability to disseminate systemically and to escape an activated immune response. Here, we endeavoured to investigate if metastatic dissemination reflects acquisition of genomic traits that are selected for. We acquired mutation and copy number data from 8332 tumours representing 19 cancer types acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the...",

Based on hematologic parameters and cytogenetic abnormalities, the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System is currently used for this purpose. In the past years, the use of massively parallel DNA sequencing has clarified...",

          "description": "The engagement of the B cell receptor (BcR) on the surface of leukemic cells represents a key event in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) since it can lead to the maintenance and expansion of the neoplastic clone. This notion was initially suggested by observations of the CLL BcR repertoire and of correlations existing between certain BcR features and the clinical outcomes of single patients. Based on these observations, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which block BcR signaling, have been...",
