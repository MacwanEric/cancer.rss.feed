          "description": "Cancer initiation is orchestrated by interplay between tumor-initiating cells and their stromal/immune environment. Here, by adapted single-cell RNA sequencing, we decipher the predicted signaling between tissue-resident hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and their neoplastic counterparts with their native niches in the human bone marrow. LEPR+ stromal cells are identified as central regulators of hematopoiesis through predicted interactions with all cells in the marrow. Inflammatory...",

Environmental stressors which, like air pollution, generate oxidative stress at the cellular level, may induce somatic mutations and some mutations may provide a selection advantage for persistence and expansion of specific clones.

Acute or chronic inflammation related to age influences the clonal evolution and the immune response.

Patients and Methods We used targeted sequencing (TS) to analyse 78 longitudinal cfDNA samples collected from 30 patients with HGSOC enrolled in a phase II clinical trial evaluating cediranib (VEGF inhibitor) plus olaparib (PARPi) after progression on PARPi alone. cfDNA was collected at baseline, before treatment cycle 2,...",

          "description": "Tissue biopsy is essential for NSCLC diagnosis and treatment management. Over the past decades, liquid biopsy has proven to be a powerful tool in clinical oncology, isolating tumor-derived entities from the blood. Liquid biopsy permits several advantages over tissue biopsy: it is non-invasive, and it should provide a better view of tumor heterogeneity, gene alterations, and clonal evolution. Consequentially, liquid biopsy has gained attention as a cancer biomarker tool, with growing clinical...",
