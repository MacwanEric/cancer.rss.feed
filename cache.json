Methylation patterns are maintained during mitosis via DNMT1, and regulatory factors involved in processes that include histone modifications. Methylation in a sequence longer than CpG can influence the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors, thus affecting gene expression. 5-Methylcytosine deamination results in C-to-T transition. While some mutations are beneficial, most are not; so...",

          "description": "The discovery of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) heterogeneity have had major implications for investigations of hematopoietic stem cell disorders, clonal hematopoiesis and HSC aging. More recent studies of the heterogeneity of HSC organelles have begun to provide additional insights into the HSC behavior with far reaching ramifications for mechanistic understanding of aging of HSCs and stem cell-derived diseases. Mitochondrial heterogeneity has been explored to expose HSC subsets with distinct...",
