Individuals with CH are at an increased risk of developing hematopoietic malignancies.

In a fashion similar to CH, animals show signs of disease late in life when they develop a wide range of myeloid neoplasms, including acute myeloid...",

Since blood lipids are the leading risk factor for atherosclerosis development, lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins reduces the risk of future cardiovascular events.

          "description": "Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis caused by precipitation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in individuals with hyperuricemia. Acute flares are accompanied by secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1B). Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an age-related condition predisposing to hematologic cancers and cardiovascular disease. CHIP is associated with elevated IL-1B, thus we investigated CHIP as a risk factor for gout. To test the...",

Indeed, CH detection is now an emerging aspect in clinical practice. The awareness of CH intersects with consolidated diagnostic paths, thus exposing 'grey zone' circumstances under the magnifying lens of clinicians. The interpretation of genomic data poses, in some cases, a true clinical challenge, sometimes further complicating the route to diagnosis. The line...",

          "description": "Immunoediting, the loss of tumor (neo)antigens due to T cell-dependent selection, sculpts tumor immunogenicity. In Nature, ≈Åuksza et al. conceive a model to score neoantigens' immunogenicity and predict tumor clonal evolution. With this model, they demonstrate that durable tumor control associates with selective limited acquisition of high-quality mutations.",

These new insights are fundamentally changing current tumor evolution models, with broad oncological implications. Most studies are based on surgical remnant tissues, which are not available for many organs and rarely in a pan-organ setting (multiple organs from the same individual). Here, we describe an approach based...",
