JAKs noncovalently associate with cytokine receptors, mediate receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and recruit STAT proteins.Tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs dimerize and are transported into the nucleus to function as transcription factors. Signaling is attenuated by specific suppressor of cytokine signaling...",

          "description": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a common aging-related process that predisposes individuals to various inflammatory responses, has been reported to be associated with COVID-19 severity. However, the immunological signature and the exact gene expression program by which the presence of CHIP exerts its clinical impact on COVID-19 remain to be elucidated. In this study, we generated a single-cell transcriptome landscape of severe COVID-19 according to the presence of CHIP...",

The disease may present as cutaneous mastocytosis or systemic mastocytosis (SM). On the basis of histopathological and molecular features, clinical variables, and organ involvement, SM is divided into indolent SM, smoldering SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, aggressive SM, and MC leukemia. Each variant is defined by unique...",

          "description": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy originating from malignant and clonally expanding plasma cells. MM can be molecularly stratified, and its clonal evolution deciphered based on the Ig heavy and light chains of the respective malignant plasma cell clone. Of all MM subtypes, IgE type MM accounts for only <0.1% of cases and is associated with an aggressive clinical course and consequentially dismal prognosis. In such malignancies, adoptive transfer of autologous lymphocytes...",

          "description": "How cells control gene expression is a fundamental question. The relative contribution of protein-level and RNA-level regulation to this process remains unclear. Here, we perform a proteogenomic analysis of tumors and untransformed cells containing somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). By revealing how cells regulate RNA and protein abundances of genes with SCNAs, we provide insights into the rules of gene regulation. Protein complex genes have a strong protein-level regulation while...",

CH originates through mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) which provide a proliferative advantage over unmutated HSPCs and has been characterized as a risk factor for myeloid neoplasm (MN) development.
