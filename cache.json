In the last years this age-associated phenomenon has been extensively studied, and several cohort studies found association between CH and age-related diseases, esp. leukaemia and cardiovascular disease. For patients with CH present with abnormal blood counts,...",

In cancers that lack a single dominant oncogene mutation, cooperation between the inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes can drive tumor initiation and growth. Here, we shed light on how the sequential acquisition of genomic alterations generates oncogene-negative lung tumors. We couple tumor barcoding with combinatorial and multiplexed somatic genome editing to...",
