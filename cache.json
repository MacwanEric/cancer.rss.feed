          "description": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) represents the clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny driven by somatic mutations. Accurate risk assessment of CH is critical for disease prevention and clinical decision-making. The size of CH has been showed to associate with higher disease risk, yet, factors influencing the size of CH are unknown. In addition, the characteristics of CH in long-lived individuals are not well documented. Here, we report an in-depth analysis of CH in longevous...",

However, the mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to disease initiation remain unresolved and mutation-specific targeting has remained elusive. To address this, we developed a human disease model that recapitulates the disease trajectory from ASXL1-mutant CH to lethal myeloid malignancy. We demonstrate that mutations in ASXL1 lead to the...",

CH is a common and age-related phenomenon that is associated with an increased risk of hematological malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. While CH is a term of the hematological aspect, there exists a complex interaction with other organ systems,...",

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. Cytogenetics and molecular findings are a prerequisite for these syndromes as they confirm the clonal nature of the disease. However, MDS is often linked to autoimmunity and inflammation as part of its pathogenesis. Recently, VEXAS syndrome...",

The relative timing and evolutionary dynamics of subclones that have escaped immune control remain incompletely characterized, and how immune-mediated selection shapes the epigenome has received little attention. Here, we infer the genome- and epigenome-driven evolutionary dynamics of tumour-immune coevolution within primary colorectal cancers (CRCs). We utilise our existing CRC multi-region multi-omic dataset that we...",
