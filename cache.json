          "description": "Aging is associated with increased mutational burden in every tissue studied. Occasionally, fitness-increasing mutations will arise, leading to stem cell clonal expansion. This process occurs in several tissues but has been best studied in blood. Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with an increased risk of blood cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia, which result if additional cooperating mutations occur. Surprisingly, it is also associated with an increased risk of nonmalignant diseases, such...",

Two distinct models have been proposed as mechanisms of stem cell homeostasis. According to the classical model, there is hierarchy among stem cells, and master stem cells produce stem cells by asymmetric division; whereas, according to the recent model, stem cells are equipotent and neutrally compete. However, the mechanism remains controversial in several tissues and species. Here, we...",

          "description": "Chronologic age is the dominant risk factor for coronary artery disease but the features of aging promoting coronary artery disease are poorly understood. Advances in human genetics and population-based genetic profiling of blood cells have uncovered the surprising role of age-related subclinical leukemogenic mutations in blood cells, termed \"clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential,\" in coronary artery disease. Such mutations typically occur in DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, and JAK2. Murine and...",

A survey of known recurrent somatic missense variants in DNMT3A, SF3B1, SRSF2 and TP53, some of the most prominent genes underlying CH of indeterminate potential (CHIP), in gnomAD non-cancer database shows the presence of 73 variants.

          "description": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an expansion of clones in individuals without any hematologic abnormalities, often carrying the driver mutations implicated in myeloid tumors, such as DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1. Most notably, CH is an age-related event, accounting for ~ 10% of cases in people over 60 years old. CH may also be correlated with a previous history of cancer treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs/radiation and infection episodes. The link between aging and CH acquisition is best explained by...",

CH mutations are predominantly found in aged populations and correlate with an increased incidence of cardiovascular and other diseases.

The genetic and cytogenetic alterations that initiate and drive the development of MPNs have largely been defined, and we summarize these here.",

To gain mechanistic insights, we developed a model for acquired resistance to chemotherapy by treating mice carrying patient derived xenografts (PDX) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with widely-used cytotoxic drugs for 18 consecutive weeks. In two distinct PDX samples, tumors initially responded to treatment, until stable disease and eventually tumor re-growth evolved under therapy, at...",
