          "description": "Several cases such as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) with the coexistence of JAK2 and BCR-ABL have been reported. However, cases of transformation of essential thrombocythemia (ET) into chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) during the disease progression were rarely reported. Here, we report the case of a patient with JAK2 V617F- positive ET who subsequently acquired BCR-ABL1, which transformed the disease into CML after 10 years from the initial diagnosis. In this study, we dynamically monitored...",
