What remains unclear is why some individuals develop clonal hematopoiesis (CH), and why does CH due to specific mutations occur in specific individuals. Much like aging, reduced diversity of HSCs is a complex phenotype shaped by numerous factors (germline & environment). The purpose of the current review is to discuss the role of two other age-related ubiquitous processes that might...",

Applying whole genome sequencing (WGS) in one case and whole exome sequencing (WES) in additional twelve, this study adds information on the molecular landscape of FDCS, expanding knowledge on pathobiological mechanisms and identifying novel markers of potential theragnostic significance.

The patient developed moderate chronic graft-versus-host disease on day 174, and the abnormal clones identified by dic(18;20)...",

In 5-10% of patients the disease transforms into a diffuse large-B cell lymphoma known as Richter transformation (RT), which is associated with dismal prognosis. Here, we aimed to establish patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to study the molecular features and evolution of CLL and RT. We generated two PDXs by injecting CLL (PDX12) and RT (PDX19) cells into immunocompromised NSG mice. Both PDXs...",

However, the impact of clonal evolution on the actionable proteome and response to targeted therapy is not known.

Targeted next generation sequencing and proteome analysis indicate persistence of actionable genome variants and stable proteomes through disease progression. Paired...",
