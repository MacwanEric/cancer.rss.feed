          "description": "Myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS) are heterogeneous, clonal myeloid neoplasms characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, progressive cytopenias, and an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. The diversity in disease severity, morphology, and genetic landscape challenges not only novel drug development but also therapeutic response assessment. The MDS International Working Group (IWG) response criteria were first published in the year 2000 focusing on measures of blast...",

          "description": "Glioblastoma (GBM) recurrence originates from invasive margin cells that escape surgical debulking, but to what extent these cells resemble their bulk counterparts remains unclear. Here, we generated three immunocompetent somatic GBM mouse models, driven by subtype-associated mutations, to compare matched bulk and margin cells. We find that, regardless of mutations, tumors converge on common sets of neural-like cellular states. However, bulk and margin have distinct biology. Injury-like programs...",

However, the mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab are still not fully understood and presents a significant challenge in clinical practice. In this study, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on paired tumor tissues before trastuzumab treatment (at baseline) and at progressive disease (PD) in 23 GC patients.

When a clone bearing a somatic genetic alteration, conferring comparative competitive advantage, displays sufficient outgrowth to become detectable amongst an otherwise polyclonal background in the hematopoietic system, this is called clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Somatic genetic alterations observed in CH include point mutations in cancer related genes, mosaic chromosomal alterations or a combination of these. Interestingly, clonal...",
