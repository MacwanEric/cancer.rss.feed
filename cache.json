          "description": "Chronic or recurrent episodes of acute inflammation cause attrition of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that can lead to hematopoietic failure, but they drive progression in myeloid malignancies and their precursor clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Mechanistic parallels exist between hematopoiesis in chronic inflammation and the continuously increased proliferation of myeloid malignancies, particularly myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The ability to enter dormancy, a state of deep quiescence...",

However, it is unclear whether the mutations detected in circulating blood cells can also be detected in tissues associated with atherosclerosis, where they could affect physiology locally. To address this, the presence of CH mutations in peripheral blood, atherosclerotic lesions and associated tissues was assessed in a pilot study of 31 consecutive patients with peripheral vascular...",

          "description": "Cancer represents a broad spectrum of molecularly and morphologically diverse diseases. Individuals with the same clinical diagnosis can have tumors with drastically different molecular profiles and clinical response to treatment. It remains unclear when these differences arise during disease course and why some tumors are addicted to one oncogenic pathway over another. Somatic genomic aberrations occur within the context of an individual's germline genome, which can vary across millions of...",
