Historically, t-MN has been considered to be a direct consequence of DNA damage induced in normal hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells (HSPC) by CT. However, we now know that treatment-induced mutations in HSC are not the only players involved in t-MN development, but additional factors may contribute to the onset of t-MN. One of the...",

JAK2 mutations are also frequent in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) in otherwise \"healthy\" individuals. However, the period between mutation acquisition and MPN diagnosis (known as latency) varies widely between individuals, with JAK2 mutations detectable several decades before diagnosis and even from birth in some individuals.

Theoretically, in the absence of early diagnosis and medication, the patient's outcome will be poor. The patients are usually diagnosed at an early age. Hence, encountering a non-treated and terminal-period patient is rare. Our case was unique because it showed the clinical picture and atypical radiological distribution of a 20-year-old,...",

          "description": "As the fundamental unit of a gene and its transcripts, nucleotides have enormous impacts on the gene function and evolution, and thus on phenotypes and diseases. In order to identify the key nucleotides of one specific gene, it is quite crucial to quantitatively measure the importance of each base on the gene. However, there are still no sequence-based methods of doing that. Here, we proposed Base Importance Calculator (BIC), an algorithm to calculate the importance score of each single base...",

Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq) can be used to investigate clonal heterogeneity and to inform phylogeny reconstruction. However, most existing phylogenetic methods for scDNAseq data are designed either for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or for large copy number alterations (CNAs), or are not applicable to targeted sequencing. Here, we develop...",
