Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a recently recognized biological mechanism conferring risk of several chronic aging diseases including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease and liver disease.

Individuals with CH are asymptomatic but have an increased risk of developing leukemia, cardiovascular and pulmonary inflammatory diseases, and severe infections. Using genetic engineering of human HSCs (hHSCs) and transplantation in immunodeficient mice, we describe how a commonly mutated gene in CH, TET2,...",

Adult hematopoietic stem cells can adaptively modulate hematopoietic output in direct response to acute infection and inflammation. Conversely, prolonged exposure to inflammation can drive impaired HSC function, clonal expansion, and malignant transformation. As compared with adult hematopoiesis, the effects of prenatal inflammation on developing hematopoietic stem cells are...",

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) should be performed as early as possible once monocytes continue to increase or are associated with phenotypic abnormalities or genetic mutations. The unique value of this study is that although there were case reports about AA-derived acute leukemia, we suggested that an early high proportion of monocytes may predict malignant clonal...",

          "description": "CONCLUSION: Considering the low TP53 variant allele fraction in blood, absence of variant detection in oral swab and saliva samples, the lack of LFS clinical criteria, and history of exposure to environmental risk factors for cancer, the main hypothesis for this case was aberrant clonal expansion due to clonal hematopoiesis. Oncologists should interpret TP53 findings during germline testing with caution.",

While most coding mutations are deleterious, almost all protein-coding genes lack detectable signals of negative selection. This raises the question of how tumors tolerate such large amounts of deleterious mutations.

The mechanisms of the pathogenesis and progression of MM include genetic abnormalities of the MM cells and the interaction between MM cells and bone marrow microenvironment (BMME). MM cells start malignant proliferation in BMME and contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of MM through direct or indirect interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix.

          "description": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide, most notably in Europe and North America. Great strides have been made in combining the most effective conventional therapies to improve survival at least in the short and medium term. The start of treatment can only be made once a diagnosis is made, which at this point, the tumor volume is already very high in the primary cancer and systemically. If caught at the earliest opportunity (in circa 20% patients) surgical resection of the...",
