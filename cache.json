          "description": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), characterized by blood cells predominantly originating from a single mutated hematopoietic stem cell, is linked to diverse aging-related diseases, including hematologic malignancy and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). While CH is common among older adults, the underlying factors driving its development are largely unknown. To address this, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 8,374 blood DNA samples collected from 4,187 Atherosclerosis Risk in...",

          "description": "We report a case of Klippel Trenaunay Syndrome that was monitored both clinically and molecularly over a period of 9 years. A somatic mosaic mutation of PIK3CA (p(E545G)) was identified using both cfDNA NGS liquid biopsy and tissue biopsy. At the age of 56, due to intervening clonal mutations in PIK3CA background, she developed a squamous cell carcinoma in the right affected leg which was treated surgically. Nine years later, lung bilateral adenocarcinoma arose on PIK3CA mutated tissues...",
