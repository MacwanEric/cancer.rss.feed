The advent of modern genomic technologies has helped recognizing that CH is common in elderly healthy subjects as a result of the aging bone marrow (BM). CH in healthy subjects without abnormalities in blood counts is known as CH of indeterminate potential. CH is also seen in BM failure (BMF) disorders. Whether CH alarms...",

In addition, it is thought that infiltration of inflammatory cells with somatic mutations into cancer tissues may change the tumor microenvironment.

The nonmalignant clonal expansion of somatic mutations in the hematopoietic system is termed clonal hematopoiesis. This review will briefly discuss...",

When these mutations occur in \"driver\" genes, they can potentially confer fitness advantages to the cell, leading to a clonal expansion.

WGD can provide a source of redundant genes to buffer the deleterious effect of somatic alterations and facilitate clonal evolution in cancer cells.

Among these are DNA damage caused by the abortive mitosis that initially...",

          "description": "Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) methods are powerful tools for profiling mutations in cancer cells; however, most genomic regions sequenced in single cells are non-informative. To overcome this issue, we developed a multi-patient-targeted (MPT) scDNA-seq method. MPT involves first performing bulk exome sequencing across a cohort of cancer patients to identify somatic mutations, which are then pooled together to develop a single custom targeted panel for high-throughput scDNA-seq using a...",

High-risk neuroblastoma patients have a poor overall survival and account for ~15% of childhood cancer deaths. There is thus a need for clinically relevant and authentic models of neuroblastoma that closely resemble the human disease to further interrogate underlying mechanisms and to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Here we review recent developments in patient-derived neuroblastoma xenograft models and in...",

The p53 protein acts as a transcription factor, and it is involved in DNA repair, senescence, cell-cycle control, autophagy, and apoptosis. Beyond cancer, there is evidence that TP53 is associated with fertility, aging, and longevity. Additionally, more evidence exists that genetic variants in TP53 are associated with environmental adaptation. Special TP53 amino-acid residues or...",
