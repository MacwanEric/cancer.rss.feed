          "description": "Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) is a group of chronic blood cancers that arise from a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clone with somatic mutations causing constitutive activation of myeloid cytokine receptor signaling. In addition to elevated blood cell counts, MPN typically presents with increased inflammatory signaling and inflammation symptoms. Therefore, while being a clonally derived neoplasm, MPN has much in common with chronic non-cancerous inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid...",

          "description": "Recent larger-scale studies of patients with cancer and longitudinal population cohorts have revealed how age-related expansions of mutant hematopoietic cells (clonal hematopoiesis [CH]) have differential associations with incident and prevalent cancers and their outcomes. Increasing recognition and deeper understanding of genetic subtypes of CH are yielding insights into the tumor-immune interface that may help to explain the heterogeneous impact of CH on tumorigenesis and treatment. Herein, we...",

First described in 1922, PRCA may be a primary autoimmune or clonal myeloid or lymphoid disorder, but may also be secondary to other disorders of immune dysregulation/autoimmunity, to infections, to neoplasms, or to drugs. Insights from the study of PRCA have helped illuminate...",

In gliomas and other brain tumors, targeted sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may help differential diagnosis when surgery is not recommended and be more representative of tumor heterogeneity than surgical specimens, unveiling targetable genetic alterations.

Adult hematopoietic stem cells can adaptively modulate hematopoietic output in direct response to acute infection and inflammation.

The mechanisms of the pathogenesis and progression of MM include genetic abnormalities of the MM cells and the interaction between MM cells and bone marrow microenvironment (BMME). MM cells start malignant proliferation in BMME and contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of MM through direct or indirect interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix.

          "description": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide, most notably in Europe and North America. Great strides have been made in combining the most effective conventional therapies to improve survival at least in the short and medium term. The start of treatment can only be made once a diagnosis is made, which at this point, the tumor volume is already very high in the primary cancer and systemically. If caught at the earliest opportunity (in circa 20% patients) surgical resection of the...",
