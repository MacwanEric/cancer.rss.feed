The recent evidence in the field of immunology and the application of next-generation sequencing have shed light on the molecular underpinnings of these clonal complications, revealing clinical and molecular risk factors as well as potential immunological players. Particularly, whether MN evolution represents a...",

As CHIP-associated mutations are known to alter the development and function of myeloid cells, we hypothesized that CHIP may also be associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disease in which brain-resident myeloid cells are thought to have a major role. To perform association tests between CHIP and AD dementia, we analyzed blood DNA sequencing data from 1,362...",

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) should be performed as early as possible once monocytes continue to increase or are associated with phenotypic abnormalities or genetic mutations. The unique value of this study is that although there were case reports about AA-derived acute leukemia, we suggested that an early high proportion of monocytes may predict malignant clonal...",

          "description": "Liquid biopsy has become a significant tool in personalized medicine, enabling real-time monitoring of cancer evolution and patient follow-up. This minimally invasive procedure analyzes circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor-derived materials, such as ctDNA, miRNAs, and EVs. CTC analysis significantly impacts prognosis, detection of minimal residual disease (MRD), treatment selection, and monitoring of cancer patients. Liquid biopsy is an attractive option for mouth cancer...",

In the bone marrow, clonal progenitors can undergo malignant transformation to acute leukaemia, or differentiate into immune cells that contribute to disease pathology in peripheral tissues^(1-4). Outside the marrow, these clones are potentially exposed to a variety of tissue-specific mutational processes, although the consequences of this are unclear.
