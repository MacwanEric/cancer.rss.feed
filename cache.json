The trueness and precision of IOS in the partial and complete arches remain unclear and require further assessment. Based on follow-up clinical studies, IOS impressions were accurate in clinical practice. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, as some evidences are obtained from the same research group.",

          "description": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common age-related phenomenon that occurs when hematopoietic stem cells acquire mutations in a select set of genes commonly mutated in myeloid neoplasia which then expand clonally. Current sequencing assays to detect CHIP are not optimized for the detection of these variants and can be cost-prohibitive when applied to large cohorts or serial sequencing. Here, we present and validate a CHIP targeted sequencing assay that is affordable...",

          "description": "Somatic mutations accumulate in all cells with age and can confer a selective advantage, leading to clonal expansion over time. In hematopoietic cells, mutations in a subset of genes regulating DNA repair or epigenetics frequently lead to clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Here, we describe the context and mechanisms that lead to enrichment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with mutations in SRCAP, which encodes a chromatin remodeler that also influences DNA repair. We show that SRCAP mutations confer...",

          "description": "Acquired myeloid malignancies are a spectrum of clonal disorders known to be caused by sequential acquisition of genetic lesions in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, leading to their aberrant self-renewal and differentiation. The increasing use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to study myeloid malignancies has helped usher a paradigm shift in approaches to disease modeling and drug discovery, especially when combined with gene-editing technology. The process of...",

We analyzed data from three datasets (TCGA-UVM, GSE27831, GSE51880) with information regarding M3, 8q, 6p, SF3B1, and BAP1 status. We confirm that BAP1 mutations are always associated with M3 in high-risk patients. All other...",

Yet in contrast to invasive cancer, many DCIS tumors do not progress and may remain indolent over decades. To better understand the heterogenous nature of this disease, we reconstructed the growth dynamics of 18 DCIS tumors based on the geo-spatial distribution of their somatic mutations. The somatic mutation topographies revealed that DCIS is multiclonal and consists of...",
