          "description": "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an autosomal dominant rare disease characterized by foot deformities and concomitant heterotopic ossifications. Theoretically, in the absence of early diagnosis and medication, the patient's outcome will be poor. The patients are usually diagnosed at an early age. Hence, encountering a non-treated and terminal-period patient is rare. Our case was unique because it showed the clinical picture and atypical radiological distribution of a 20-year-old,...",

Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations to DNMT3A, including the hotspot mutation R882H, frequently occur in developmental growth disorders and hematological diseases, including clonal hematopoiesis and acute myeloid leukemia. Accordingly, identifying mechanisms that activate DNMT3A is of both fundamental and therapeutic interest. Here, we applied a...",

DNAm patterns are further perturbed in hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia but the physiological significance of such epigenetic changes is unknown. Using epigenetic editing of human stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), we show that p15 methylation affects hematopoiesis in vivo. We edited the CDKN2B (p15) promoter and ARF (p14) using dCas9-3A3L and...",

Prevention or treatment of these infections could reduce cancer cases by 23% in less developed regions and about 7% in developed regions. Contemporaneous increases in longevity and changes in lifestyle have contributed to the cancer burden in SSA. African hospitals are reporting more cases of cancer related to...",

In order to identify the key nucleotides of one specific gene, it is quite crucial to quantitatively measure the importance of each base on the gene. However, there are still no sequence-based methods of doing that. Here, we proposed Base Importance Calculator (BIC), an algorithm to calculate the importance score of each single base...",
