          "description": "Aging represents the major risk factor for the development of cancer and many other diseases. Recent findings show that normal tissues become riddled with expanded clones that are frequently driven by cancer-associated mutations in an aging-dependent fashion. Additional studies show how aged tissue microenvironments promote the initiation and progression of malignancies, while young healthy tissues actively suppress the outgrowth of malignant clones. Here, we discuss conserved mechanisms that...",

Clinical manifestations of the disorder are varied and range from mild asymptomatic anemia to a markedly truncated life expectancy, underscoring the importance of risk-adapted therapy. MDS therapy for both lower- and higher-risk patients is an area of immense therapeutic opportunity. This is partly due to the diversity of...",

Mutations that reached the conventional threshold for CHIP (2% frequency) tended to continue growing, indicating that after CHIP is acquired, it is generally not lost. The ability to cost-effectively profile CHIP longitudinally will enable future studies to investigate why some CHIP clones expand, and how their dynamics relate to health outcomes at a biobank scale.",

Short telomere syndromes are the most prevalent premature aging disorders, with prominent phenotypes affecting the lung and hematopoietic system. Less understood are a newly recognized group of cancer-prone syndromes that are associated with mutations that lengthen telomeres. A large body of new data...",

          "description": "Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) is a recent version of quantitative PCR (QT-PCR), useful for measuring gene expression, doing clonality assays and detecting hot spot mutations. In respect of QT-PCR, ddPCR is more sensitive, does not need any reference curve and can quantify one quarter of samples already defined as \"positive but not quantifiable\". In the IgH and TCR clonality assessment, ddPCR recapitulates the allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR (ASO-PCR), being not adapt for detecting clonal...",
