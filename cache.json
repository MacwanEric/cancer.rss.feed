Several computational tools have been developed for this purpose but, in the absence of comprehensive 'ground truth' data, assessing the accuracy of these methods is challenging. We created a computational framework to simulate tumour and matched normal sequencing data for which the source of all loci that contain non-reference bases is known, based on a phased,...",

          "description": "Cancer genomes are almost invariably complex with genomic alterations cooperating during each step of carcinogenesis. In cancers that lack a single dominant oncogene mutation, cooperation between the inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes can drive tumor initiation and growth. Here, we shed light on how the sequential acquisition of genomic alterations generates oncogene-negative lung tumors. We couple tumor barcoding with combinatorial and multiplexed somatic genome editing to...",

          "description": "A hallmark of cancer is a tumor cell's ability to evade immune destruction. Somatic mutations in tumor cells that prevent immune destruction have been extensively studied. However, somatic mutations in tumor infiltrating immune (TII) cells, to our knowledge, have not been previously studied. Understandably so since normal hematopoiesis prevents the accumulation of somatic mutations in immune cells.
