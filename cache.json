Thymomas are the most common primary anterior mediastinal tumor, while ectopic thymomas are rarer. Mutational profiles of ectopic thymomas may help expand our understanding of the occurrence and treatment options of these tumors. In this report, we sought to elucidate the mutational profiles of two ectopic thymoma nodules to gain deeper understanding of the molecular genetic...",

One contributing factor is the one-size-fits-all nature of multi-modal therapy. For example, during the first step (induction chemotherapy), the standard regimen (rapid COJEC) administers fixed doses of chemotherapeutic agents in eight two-week cycles. Perhaps because of differences in resistance, this standard regimen results in highly...",
