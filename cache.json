Overall, heart disease leads to one out of every 3 deaths of American women, but unfortunately patient awareness of cardiovascular risk actually has declined since 2009. Younger women are not exempt, since their risk can be increased by smoking, birth control, adverse lifestyle and diet, and genetic disorders. Age at menarche...",

The frequency of clonal hematopoiesis is higher in patients with solid tumors, than normal individuals. In addition, it is thought that infiltration of inflammatory cells with somatic mutations into cancer tissues may change the tumor microenvironment.

High-risk neuroblastoma patients have a poor overall survival and account for ~15% of childhood cancer deaths. There is thus a need for clinically relevant and authentic models of neuroblastoma that closely resemble the human disease to further interrogate underlying mechanisms and to develop novel therapeutic strategies.
