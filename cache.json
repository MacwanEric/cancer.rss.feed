The most commonly affected genes are TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1 and JAK2. By the age of 70, at least 20-50% of all individuals carry a CH clone, conveying a striking clinical impact by...",

Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), a common complication of PMF, occurs due to the dysregulation of the bone marrow microenvironment. We report an interesting case of a 73-year-old female with a working diagnosis of ET who was found to have EMH in the liver...",

          "description": "Inadequate mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is a limiting factor to proceed with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT). To assess the impact of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) on mobilization failure of PBPC for auto-HCT, we investigated the characteristics of poor mobilizers (with total PBPC collection <2x106 CD34+ cells/kg) in a consecutive single center cohort of 776 patients. Targeted error corrected next-generation sequencing of 28 genes was performed in...",

          "description": "The detection of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in patients with hematologic neoplasms who are undergoing a cellular therapy is common. The most frequently used cellular therapy procedures include autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and, more recently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‚Äëcell therapy. All three procedures differ fundamentally in terms of harvesting and manufacturing aspects as well as usage of the respective cell product. Therefore, the importance...",

Although these are believed to arise according to the principles of somatic evolution, the exact spatial growth patterns and underlying mechanisms remain elusive^(4,5). Here, to address this need, we developed a workflow that generates detailed quantitative maps of genetic subclone composition across whole-tumour sections. These provide the basis for studying clonal growth patterns, and...",
