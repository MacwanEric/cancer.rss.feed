          "description": "Aging represents the major risk factor for the development of cancer and many other diseases. Recent findings show that normal tissues become riddled with expanded clones that are frequently driven by cancer-associated mutations in an aging-dependent fashion. Additional studies show how aged tissue microenvironments promote the initiation and progression of malignancies, while young healthy tissues actively suppress the outgrowth of malignant clones. Here, we discuss conserved mechanisms that...",

          "description": "CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that iPSCs with homozygous knockout of different exons of DNMT3A remain capable of mesenchymal and hematopoietic differentiation-and exon 23^(-/-) iHPCs even gained growth advantage-despite loss of almost the entire de novo DNA methylation. Partial recapitulation of DNA methylation patterns of AML with DNMT3A mutations by our DNMT3A knockout iHPCs indicates that our model system can help to elucidate mechanisms of clonal hematopoiesis.",

          "description": "BACKGROUND Clonal hematopoiesis is the production of a specific single clonal type of cell in the blood and is often found in cancer genomic profiling tests. When the clone carries a pathogenic variant, it may be important to differentiate between somatic or germline origin. The variant in the blood that has a lower minor allele frequency could reflect heterozygous germline origin, somatic mosaicism, and clonal hematopoiesis. It is important to evaluate suspected variants to determine the course...",

          "description": "An appropriate production of mature blood cells, or hematopoiesis, is essential for organismal health and homeostasis. In this developmental cascade, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiate into intermediate progenitor types, that subsequently give rise to the many distinct blood cell lineages. Here, we describe tools and methods that permit for temporal and native clonal-level HSC lineage tracing in the mouse, and that can now be combined with emerging single-cell molecular analyses. We...",

Here, through analysis of large panel-based genomic datasets from the AACR GENIE project, including 40,979 primary and metastatic tumors across 25 distinct cancer types, we explore how the evolutionary pressure of cancer metastasis shapes the selection of genomic drivers of cancer.

The standard of care for PMME has not been established yet due to a lack of understanding of its clinical and molecular pathogenesis. Thus, we performed genomic profiling on a recurrent PMME case to seek novel opportunities for the management of this rare disease.

Microsatellite instability (MSI), an unfaithful replication of DNA at nucleotide repeats, occurs in about 15% of human colon tumors. MSI promotes a genetic frameshift and consequently a loss of HDAC2 in up to 43% of these tumors. We show that long-term and short-term cultures of colorectal cancers with MSI contain subpopulations of cells lacking HDAC2. These can be isolated as single...",
