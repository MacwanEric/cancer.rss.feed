The prevalence of CH increases dramatically with age. CH can be caused by somatic mutations in individual genes or by gains and or losses of larger chromosomal segments. CH is a premalignant state; the somatic mutations detected in CH are the initiating mutations for hematologic malignancies, and CH is a strong predictor for the development...",

          "description": "Accumulation of somatic hematopoietic stem cell mutations with aging has been revealed by the recent genome-wide analysis. Clonal expansion, known as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), is a premalignant condition of hematological cancers. It is defined as the absence of definitive morphological evidence of a hematological neoplasm and occurrence of ‚â•2% of mutant allele fraction in the peripheral blood. In CHIP, the most frequently mutated genes are epigenetic regulators such...",

          "description": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with BCR::ABL1 has recently been recognized as a distinct subtype in international classifications. Distinguishing it from myeloid blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (BC-CML) without evidence of a chronic phase (CP), remains challenging. We aimed to better characterize this entity by integrating clonal architecture analysis, mutational landscape assessment, and gene expression profiling. We analyzed a large retrospective cohort study including CML and AML...",

Dysregulated inflammation can skew HSC fate-related decisions, leading to aberrant hematopoiesis and potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of hematological disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

          "description": "Premalignant clonal hematopoiesis is the presence of somatic alterations in the blood of otherwise healthy individuals. Although the condition is not considered as a cancer, it carries an increased risk of developing a hematologic malignancy, particularly in those with large neoplastic clones, multiple pathogenic mutations, and high-risk mutations. In addition to the increased risk of malignancy, clonal hematopoiesis carries a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular events and death....",

AA is characterized by pancytopenia and BM hypoplasia, and is primarily caused by an autoimmune mechanism involving cytotoxic T cells that damage hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Recent genomic research has revealed that patients with AA often...",

          "description": "Myelofibrosis (MF) is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized clinically by cytopenias, fatigue, and splenomegaly stemming from extramedullary hematopoiesis. MF commonly arises from mutations in JAK2, MPL, and CALR, which manifests as hyperactive Jak/Stat signaling. Triple-negative MF is diagnosed in the absence of JAK2, MPL, and CALR but when clinical, morphologic criteria are met and other mutation(s) is/are present, including ASXL1, EZH2, and SRSF2. While the clinical and...",

Contemporary single-cell lineage-tracing (scLT) methods use expressed, heritable DNA barcodes to combine cell lineage readout with single-cell transcriptomics. However, reliance on transcriptional profiling limits adaptation to other single-cell assays. With CellTag-multi, we present an approach that enables direct capture of heritable random barcodes expressed as polyadenylated transcripts, in both single-cell RNA...",

          "description": "Measurable residual disease (MRD), defined as the population of cancer cells that persist following therapy, serves as the critical reservoir for disease relapse in acute myeloid leukemia and other malignancies. Understanding the biology enabling MRD clones to resist therapy is necessary to guide the development of more effective curative treatments. Discriminating between residual leukemic clones, preleukemic clones, and normal precursors remains a challenge with current MRD tools. Here, we...",

          "description": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a genetically complex hematological cancer characterized by the abnormal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. This disease progresses from a premalignant condition known as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) through sequential genetic alterations involving various genes. These genetic changes contribute to the uncontrolled growth of multiple clones of plasma cells. In this study, we present a phenotype-structured model that...",

          "description": "Myelodysplastic syndromes or neoplasms (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid clonal disorders characterized by peripheral blood cytopenias, blood and marrow cell dysplasia, and increased risk of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, serve as regulators of normal and malignant hematopoiesis and have been implicated in carcinogenesis. This review presents a comprehensive summary of the biology and role of non-coding RNAs,...",
