CHIP associates with advanced age and increased risk for hematological malignancy, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Loss-of-function somatic mutations in TET2 are frequent drivers of CHIP. However, the contribution of aging-associated cooperating...",

The most commonly affected genes are TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1 and JAK2. By the age of 70, at least 20-50% of all individuals carry a CH clone, conveying a striking clinical impact by...",

          "description": "CONCLUSION: Our study showed an elevation of TNF and AMPK signalling pathways in MDS. TNF signalling might be mediating the proliferative advantage to myeloid clonal cells (mutation carrying cells) over normal cells, whereas, AMPK signalling could be acting as protector against it (favouring normal cells). Hence it would be interesting to explore the functions and pathways associated with mTOR, AMPK, MAPK8 and JUNB in myelopoiesis related diseases like MDS.",

However, recent sequencing studies have unveiled that non-cancerous cells also carry a considerable number of somatic mutations, which are acquired continuously through the lifespan. Accordingly, the pathophysiological relevance of somatic mutagenesis beyond cancer has become a topic of intensive research.

TET2 mutation causes abnormal epigenetic landscape changes and results in multiple stages of lineage commitment/differentiation defects as well as genetic instability in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs).

          "description": "Similar with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), aplastic anemia (AA) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are the major bone marrow failure syndromes. Approximately 10-20% of patients with AA/PNH present with transformation into MDS. Clonal hematopoiesis in AA/PNH affected by karyotypic abnormalities and genetic mutations should be discriminated from MDS clone, which is sometimes difficult due to shared genetic events among these diseases. In patients with AA/PNH, clones with UPD6p and...",
