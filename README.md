# About

This is repository hosts the UI and content of an RSS feed reader. I have added a webpage [Cancer Interest Feed](https://macwaneric.github.io/cancer_rss_feed/) to generate RSS feeds of manuscripts, review articles and news highlights for my research interest topics. Iâ€™m using PubMed to generate RSS links and osmofeed as a feed extractor. Here I am channelling extracted articles on my webpage to keep everything in one place for my ease of access and greater control over the content.
